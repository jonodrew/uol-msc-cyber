## Summary
- in a closed source system, the use of an [[initialization vector|IV]] offers attackers a chance to leak the user's [[encryption key]]
- it also offers the chance for the software to select an alternative algorithm, which the authors term an algorithm substitution attack (ASA)
- the authors note that in order to achieve [[Serious cryptography#^ad48d6|IND-CPA]], [[encryption]] must be stateful
