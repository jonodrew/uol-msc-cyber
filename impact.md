### Definition
>The result of an [[Information security]] [[incident]], caused by a [[threat]], which affects [[asset|assets]]
>\- ([[ISO 27000|ISO/IEC 27000]])

In [[Information security management principles]], the authors argue only from a perspective of the size of the impact. For example,
>If the impact is small and insignificant – a wet coat in the example above – then it may be entirely appropriate to accept the risk and to take no further action other than to monitor it. On the other hand, if the potential impact could be dismissal from a well-paid job, then more appropriate countermeasures need to be considered – the purchase of an umbrella, hiring a taxi or similar.
>\-[[Information security management principles]], Chapter 1

However, I think it's worth considering impact as a cost-benefit. For example: if a [[data breach]] occured, the [[Information Commissioner’s Office|ICO]] might fine us $1m. However, if our more lax approach to data storage means we can increase market share and turn a profit of $2m, then it's good sense to accept the [[risk]].
