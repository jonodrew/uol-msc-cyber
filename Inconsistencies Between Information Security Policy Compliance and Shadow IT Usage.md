## notes
- shadow IT is "an adaptation by employees to their work for improving efficiency and bypassing the limitations of official IT resources"
- they have huge value
- they're also (potentially) great big gaping holes in the information security posture
- paper is investigating the discrepancies between the intention and behaviour of users, with regards to information security policies (ISPs)
- self-efficacy rears its head again, as we're doing [[social cognitive theory]]
	- this is the personal appraisal of one's own abilities
	- people with high self-efficacy (in a problem space) will confront and try to solve a problem; those without will ignore or avoid it
- other research seems to indicate that people with high self-efficacy (computer specific?) tend to demonstrate greater compliance with ISPs
- ironically, some of those people are also the most likely to use shadow IT
- **shadow IT exists because the organisational IT department is not meeting a user need**
- interesting experiment design - participants were asked to email a paper to someone, but the email client would almost always time out. There was a prize on offer for completion of the task, so what do users do?
