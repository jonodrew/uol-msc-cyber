> - Most users don't understand why we have security policies
> - tragically, some that do use that information to subvert them
> - most users don't have a good sense of [[attacker]] capabilities
> - However, most users are also security conscious: they just don't know what to secure, or how. They are enthusiastic amateurs, and our job is to nurture and develop that, rather than gatekeeping the sacred knowledge
> - paper draws incorrect inference that there is a military principle of need to know, which states that there more known about a security mecahnism the easier it is to attack. In fact, [[need to know]] is closer to separation of privilege
> - implementing need to know runs counter to the process of generating trust, which is openness: cf. [[Trust - an element of information security]]
