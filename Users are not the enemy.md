> - Another shoutout for [[Grounded Theory]]
> - When users (in their opinion) are forced to circumvent security to do their job, their regard for security decreases - and they become slightly less likely to perform other compliant actions
> - Most users don't understand why we have security policies
> - tragically, some that do use that information to subvert them
> - most users don't have a good sense of [[attacker]] capabilities
> - However, most users are also security conscious: they just don't know what to secure, or how. They are enthusiastic amateurs, and our job is to nurture and develop that, rather than gatekeeping the sacred knowledge
> - paper slightly abuses the military principle of need to know, which states that the more known about a security mechanism the easier it is to attack. In fact, [[need to know]] is closer to separation of privilege. Security _mechanisms_ ought to be open - cf. [[Kerckhoffs' six principles#Open Design]]
> - However, security teams implement [[need to know]] in terms of security incidents and sensitive information - on the basis that if it's more widely known it's more likely to leak
> - although this is true, it also means that users don't have a good understanding of the threats they're up against - and so don't act (according to the security team) *rationally*
> - implementing need to know runs counter to the process of generating trust, which is openness: cf. [[Trust - an element of information security]]
