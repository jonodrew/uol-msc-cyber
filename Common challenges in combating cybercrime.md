As identified by [[Eurojust]] and [[Europol]]

## Chapter 2: Common challenges
### 2.1 Loss of data
#### 2.1.a Data retention
- Data Retention Directive was overturned by the [[European Court of Justice]], and now law enforcement are uncertain about what mechanisms they have to obtain data from private parties
-  Europol believes there's a need for a new legislative framework regulating data retention of law enforcement purposes at EU-level
#### 2.1.b [[Internet]] governance-related challenges
- 'Carrier-grade network address translation', or CGN
- Because there aren't enough [[IPv4 address|IPv4 addresses]], ISPs use CGN technology to share a single public IPv4 address with thousands of subscribers
	- *ah*
- this means tracking down who was on the end of an IP address is significantly more difficult
- [[IPv6 address|if only there were another approach we could use]]
- [[Europol]] would also like ESPs/ISPs to log source port information
- also
- [[WHOIS]] abiding by [[GDPR]] has been a real blow for law enforcement
	- stupid [[Internet Corporation for Addresses Names and Numbers|ICANN]]
	- thankfully apparently they're coming with an expedited process
	- though that won't deal with disclosing 'non-public' data
	- and [[ICANN]] probably won't adopt a consensus policy on giving law enforcement access to it
#### 2.1.c [[encryption]]
- *sigh*
- there's a really weird use of the word 'misuse' here. To me it implies that the author thinks that "legal" and "correct" use are the same thing. From a linguistic perspective I disagree: the problem we have is that criminals use this software correctly, thereby preventing law enforcement access to the data
#### 2.1.d [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]]
- criminals use them
- there is no bank, and therefore nobody for law enforcement to lean on
- additionally, because of the lack of regulation and banks, there's nobody to protect crypto users - and crime against crypto-holding individuals is on the increase
### 2.2 Loss of location
- criminals operating in the online space raises the problem of jurisdiction:
	- particularly when it comes to real-time monitoring or interception of communications
### 2.3 Challenges associated with national legal frameworks
- different legislative frameworks
- not much in the way of international coordination
- ideally [[Europol]] want an [[EU]]-wide legal framework
### 2.4 Obstacles to international cooperation
#### 2.4.a mutual legal assistance (MLA) related challenges
- no common legal framework for international expedited sharing of evidence
- there is an international legal framework for preserving evidence
#### 2.4.b Challenges in responding to large-scale cyber-attacks
- attacks like [[NotPetya]] and [[WannaCry]] require collective response
- so far that's not where we are, but there's work in place to get there

### 2.5 Challenges of public-private partnerships
#### 2.5.a legal framework
- we need some kind of legal framework to support the interface between the private sector, where the data is, and the public sector, who needs it
- there is a legislative balance between privacy and proportionate measures to support law enforcement
#### 2.5.b jurisdiction
- it seems that criminal organisations are taking advantage of the fact that there is no international jurisdiction
#### 2.5.c challenges associated with new and emerging technologies
