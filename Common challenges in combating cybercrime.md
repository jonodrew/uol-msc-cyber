## Chapter 2: Common challenges
### 2.1 Loss of data
#### 2.1.a Data retention
- Data Retention Directive was overturned by the [[European Court of Justice]], and now law enforcement are uncertain about what mechanisms they have to obtain data from private parties
-  Europol believes there's a need for a new legislative framework regulating data retention of law enforcement purposes at EU-level
#### 2.1.b [[Internet]] governance-related challenges
- 'Carrier-grade network address translation', or CGN
- Because there aren't enough [[IPv4 address|IPv4 addresses]], ISPs use CGN technology to share a single public IPv4 address with thousands of subscribers
	- *ah*
- this means tracking down who was on the end of an IP address is significantly more difficult
- [[IPv6 address|if only there were another approach we could use]]
- [[Europol]] would also like ESPs/ISPs to log source port information
- also
- [[WHOIS]] abiding by [[GDPR]] has been a real blow for law enforcement
	- stupid [[Internet Corporation for Addresses Names and Numbers|ICANN]]
	- thankfully apparently they're coming with an expedited process
	- though that won't deal with disclosing 'non-public' data
	- and [[ICANN]] probably won't adopt a consensus policy on giving law enforcement access to it
#### 2.1.c [[encryption]]
- *sigh*
