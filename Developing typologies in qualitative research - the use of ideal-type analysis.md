## notes
- a typology is formed by grouping cases or participants into 'types', based on common features
- this paper deals with a method for creating a typology: ideal-type analysis
- it has seven steps:
	- familiarisation with the dataset
	- writing the case reconstructions
	- constructing the 'ideal types'
	- identifying the optimal cases
	- forming the ideal-type descriptions
	- checking credibility
	- making comparisons
- some methodologies are 'thematic', such as 'thematic analysis', 'grounded theory', and 'interpretative phenomenological analysis'
- this risks losing the specificity of individual experiences
- if that's more important, one could use case study methods - but of course then you lose the cross-case analysis
- one way to bring the two together is through typologies
- oh they've published a book on this, what luck
- an 'ideal type' is a sort of Platonic ideal of something, against which everything else can be measured
- it must be clear that it's constructed
- even as a construct it's useful, because it gives you a think to measure against
- there's a valuable table here about the different types of approach: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/16094069221100633
