A Danish international shipping company, MÃ¦rsk was hit by a cyber attack ([[NotPetya]]) in 2017. The attack was widely attributed to [[Russia]]. This attack may therefore have been accidental, or collateral damage.

Staff were reduced to using [[Whatsapp]], Excel, and personal email accounts to enable [[business continuity]].

The initial attack was against tax software in [[Ukraine]] called M.E.Docs. When the software polled its central servers for updates, what they got instead was [[NotPetya]].
