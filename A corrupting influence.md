## Criminal networks and criminal entrepreneurs
- organised crime reflects organised criminals

>[!quote] There is no such thing as criminal societies; there are individual criminals, and there are criminal families
>
>\- Margaret Thatcher, probably
- the number of persistent criminal networks is low, with only a quarter having been active for more than 10 years
- a third are very young, having been operating less than thre years
- around 40% are multi-sector
- they are more diverse than most businesses in the UK
- this article appears to have discovered something called 'the market economy' and I'm happy for them
- most criminal activities entail the following three steps in sequence:
	- production/recruitment/acquisition
	- transport of persons/physical goods
	- exploitation of persons/distribution of goods
- as well as the following two steps which can happen concurrently:
	- handling the money flow (accounting)
	- procuring facilitating services, including corruption
- Often these support services are not available 'in-house' and have to be procured externally

## Cybercrime
- a section on [[EMOTET]]
- a mention of [[DDoS]]
- and [[CSA|child sexual abuse]] material
	- CSA mirrors the steps above. Additionally, the vast majority of the criminals in this space are consumers. Producers are significantly smaller in number and congregate in fora that resemble other criminal organisations, including division of tasks, strict hierarchies, and codes of conduct
- non-cash payment fraud; that is, theft, identify fraud, investment fraud
- illegal drugs trade
	- this is underpinned in the EU by significant amounts of corruption
	- technology enables this trade, both at the level of production and at the distribution layer
	- the European market is among the largest for cocaine in the world
	- a growing number of organisations engaged in the cocaine industry are engaging in pro-active violence
