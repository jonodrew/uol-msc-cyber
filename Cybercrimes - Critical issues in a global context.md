## Chapter 4: Crimes against devices
- in the 50s and 60s hackers were the pioneers of computing
- in the 70s, hardware hackers began to play a pivotal role by hacking together improvements to physical hardware
- from the 80s hackers moved up the stack to software
- and it was only in the 90s that we saw 'hacktivism' 
- hackers have also been prone to weird, poorly written, metaphor heavy manifestos to justify their deviation from societal norms
	- if you were looking for more evidence that White Western dudes literally cannot help themselves
	- cf. *The Hacker Manifesto*, *Declaration of Independence (of Cyberspace)*
- odd that *Mr Robot* doesn't get a mention but *Black Mirror* does
## Chapter 8: Political offences
- honourable mention for [[stuxnet]]
- mention of the [[Lazarus Group]]
- mention of a failed (?) cyber attack on [[Saudi Arabia]] in 2018, designed to shut down the plant but also to cause an explosion. The explosion was not triggered, possibly due to a mistake in the [[malware]]
	- oh well that's fine then (!!)
- uses the term information pollution over 'fake news', which I rather like
- defines astroturfing: a fake grass-roots campaign, that has little actual depth. The appearance of depth is created by sock-puppet accounts
- identifying this information pollution is going to keep getting hard, as [[GAN|GANs]] get more powerful
- mention of [[Jenna Abrams]]!
- apparently [[Facebook]] implemented a postcard verification system form ads during the election cycle. Ad buyers had to input a code that was sent to their US address, thereby preventing overseas [[attacker|threat actors]] from buying adverts
