## Chapter 4: Crimes against devices
- in the 50s and 60s hackers were the pioneers of computing
- in the 70s, hardware hackers began to play a pivotal role by hacking together improvements to physical hardware
- from the 80s hackers moved up the stack to software
- and it was only in the 90s that we saw 'hacktivism' 
- hackers have also been prone to weird, poorly written, metaphor heavy manifestos to justify their deviation from societal norms
	- if you were looking for more evidence that White Western dudes literally cannot help themselves
	- cf. *The Hacker Manifesto*, *Declaration of Independence (of Cyberspace)*
- odd that *Mr Robot* doesn't get a mention but *Black Mirror* does
