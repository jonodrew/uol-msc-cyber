A variation of [[end-to-end encryption|E2EE]] that assumes an [[attacker|adversary]] can both observe the encrypted communication but also that they will one day compromise one of the devices.

In this model the #protocol therefore has to provide perfect [[forward secrecy]] and 'repudiable [[authentication]]', which would allow a user to deny having sent messages in the past.
