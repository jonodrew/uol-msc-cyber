## 6.1 Malicious web
### Identifying malicious websites
- what is [[web security]]?
- apparently [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] and [[public key infrastructure|PKI]] or [[public-key certificate]]s
- a malicious website is one that aims to deceive its users and conduct some activity that users don't expect it to do
	- [[phishing attacks]] can be done this way
	- scams
	- drive by download
	- [[malware]]-laden sites
- they often lack [[HTTPS]] (citation?) and [[public-key certificate|certificates]] (citation?)
- an example is the [[Gozi Virus]], which was packaged with a download from an apparently legitimate site
- [[cookie|cookies]] are a privacy nightmare, but aren't necessarily malicious
- [[browser]] vulnerabilities are a thing, and are made worse by third-party extensions. These bits of software aren't necessarily...great, and are vulnerable to [[supply chain attack]]s
