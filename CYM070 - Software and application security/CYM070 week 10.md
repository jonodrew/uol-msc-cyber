## Reading
- [[Serious cryptography#Chapter 1]], [[Serious cryptography#Chapter 2]], [[Serious cryptography#Chapter 6]]
## 10.1 [[confidentiality]]
- [[asymmetric|public-key encryption]], [[symmetric|symmetric encryption]]
- it's good (much of this was covered in CYM040)
- quick review of [[security service]]
- oh, a nice way of thinking about the relationship between [[non-repudiation]], [[authenticity]], and [[integrity]]. Specifically, [[non-repudiation]] implies [[authenticity]] which itself implies [[integrity]], but the inverse is not true
- [[confidentiality]] is completely separate

## 10.2 [[integrity]], [[authentication]], [[non-repudiation]]
- [[cryptographic hash function]]!
- [[MAC]]!
- This section is where we're assigned [[Serious cryptography#Chapter 6]] and it goes deep, deep into secure hashes
## 10.3 Why [[cryptography]] fails

## 10.4 [[cryptography]] in practice
