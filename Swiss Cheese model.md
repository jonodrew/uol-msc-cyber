A kind of [[defense in depth]] philosophy

## Reason model
This model is also used inversely by James Reason (1990), identifying four levels of human failure.
1. Unsafe acts
2. preconditions for unsafe acts: this level involves conditions such as mental fatigue, poor communication, etc
3. unsafe supervision: these preconditions can be traced back to instances of unsafe supervision
4. organisation influences will have a significant hand in creating areas of unsafe supervision
### Critique
- this model may only be useful with hindsight: there is little real-world application of the theory
- consequently we don't necessarily know what the holes are
	- not sure about this
