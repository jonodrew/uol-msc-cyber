An [[authentication]] #protocol that provides a means for workstation clients, users, and servers to authenticate to each other. 

We focus here on version 5, which uses [[symmetric|symmetric encryption]] for [[confidentiality]] and [[integrity]] protection. Kerberos is integrated into both [[Windows]] and [[Unix]] systems. 

Kerberos makes use of two different types of trusted third parties: an authentication server (AS) and a ticket-granting server (TGS). 

## Method
The client and the AS share a long-term secret key. This is used to generate a short-lived secret key which is shared between the TGS and the client (how?). The TGS is then involved (how?) in setting up the session key that is shared by both the client and the server it's trying to access. 

## [[threat model]]
### Context
Assuming an open and distributed network where users at workstations want to get access  to services running on servers that are distributed across the network. Servers should be able to restrict who accesses those services, and be able to [[authentication|authenticate]] users. In such an environment, we cannot rely on workstations to authenticate their users, because:
1. a user may gain access to a workstation: workstation â‰  user
2. a user may use their own workstation to impersonate another
3. a user may eavesdrop on exchanges and use [[replay attacks]] to gain access to a server
