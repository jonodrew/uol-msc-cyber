alias: [CVSS]

The CVSS considers a number of metrics:

basic metrics:
- access vector - can this be done remotely, or does an [[attacker]] need local access?
- access complexity - if they need access how complex is it for them to gain access?
- [[authentication]]: how many times would an attacker have to be authenticated in the course of launching this attack?
- impact on [[confidentiality]]
- impact on [[integrity]]
- impact on [[availability]]

temporal metrics:
- explotability - what [[vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] already exist to effect this [[attack]]?
- remediation level - what countermeasures are available? Is there already a patch?
- report confidence - how much do we trust the source of this proposed vulnerability?

environmental metrics:
- collateral damage potential - what happens beyond the computer system?
- target distribution - how many potential targets are there?
- [[confidentiality]] requirement
- [[integrity]] requirement
- [[availability]] requirement
