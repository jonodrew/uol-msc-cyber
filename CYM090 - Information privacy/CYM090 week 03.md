## 3.2 #privacy in a legal context
- who are the stakeholders in a legal interception?
	- The state
	- Communication service providers
	- The individual
- The (unsurprising!) position of the [[National Cyber Security Centre|NCSC]] is that:
>[!quote] Each state has the right to intercept or interrupt electronic communications in appropriate circumstances
- who are the stakeholders when it comes to an unlawful interception?
	- the [[attacker]]
	- law enforcement
	- communication service providers (again)
	- the individual
- some quotes from [[GDPR]] here, and a bit of a glossary
- the data subject is almost certainly the individual
- the data controller is the natural or legal person that determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. In short, the stakeholder that wants to process the data
- the data processor is the stakeholder that actually carries out the processing
