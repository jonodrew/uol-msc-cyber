- [[An introduction to data privacy]]
## Introduction and statistics primer
- intro to [[differential privacy]]
- framing of privacy as 'accumulative risk' - as more queries are made over a dataset, there's a greater chance of an individual being identified
- Can the privacy loss be quantified?
- What contexts might [[differential privacy]] be used in?
### Statistics refresher
- probability!
- probabilities have distributions

## How can we build differential #privacy 
- [[Laplace mechanisms]]
- suppose we have a database of people with a specific property, and we want to give the count of people with that property without giving away any further details and retaining their privacy
## Using differential #privacy in practice
- how do we deploy [[machine learning]] with [[differential privacy]] built in?
