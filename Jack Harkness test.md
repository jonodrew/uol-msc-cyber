The criteria for the Harkness Test are as follows:

- “Does this character have human intelligence (or greater)?”
- “Can it talk or otherwise communicate with language?”, and
- “Is it of maturity for its species?”

If all three are true, you can ask it for consent and reliably interpret its response
