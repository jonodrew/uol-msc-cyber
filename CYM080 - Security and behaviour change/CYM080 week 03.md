### Economic, social, individual and political contexts
- there is no such thing as 'the average user'
- security is contested, because one of the things we're drawing a line around is 'things we think are important' - and that doesn't have a universal answer
- the economic context may consider how much an organisation, or an individual, can afford to lose - and the effective 'cost' of securing data
- the social context will dictate norms, according to which people will behave
- the political context contributes to the security environment through criminalisation, regulation, and through public awareness campaigns
