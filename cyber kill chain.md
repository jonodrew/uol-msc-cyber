Developed by cuddly organisation [[Lockheed Martin]] and holy shit it's a registered trademark. And they've even shortened it to a friendly little k8-like thing: CKC7. These people are vampires. I hate them so much.
It comprises the following steps:
- Reconnaissance
- Weaponisation
- Delivery
- Exploitation
- Installation
- [[Command and Control]]
- Actions on objective
They've also produced a paper on applying this model to defence: [Gaining the advantage](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/Gaining_the_Advantage_Cyber_Kill_Chain.pdf)
