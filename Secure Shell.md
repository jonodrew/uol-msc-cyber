SSH is three #protocol on top of [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]/[[Internet Protocol|IP]]. It uses [[asymmetric|asymmetric encryption]] to create a secure connection between two hosts. It categorically does not use [[public key infrastructure|PKI]]: instead, each client keeps a copy of the host name alongside the corresponding [[public key]].
