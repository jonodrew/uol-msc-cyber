alias: [security control, security controls]

There are four main types of [[strategic]] control: [[eliminate]], [[reduce]], [[transfer]], [[accept]]. They can also be grouped into 'preventive' and 'reactive', or 'strategic' and 'operational'. Are these false binaries? (yes)

### Preventive
Controls designed to prevent a [[threat]] from arising and hence reduce [[risk]].
1. passwords and password managers
2. staff education
3. regular backups

### Reactive

1. [[intrusion detection system]]
2. incident management system

## Operational
### Physical
As you'd expect - doors, locks on doors, walls (which are technically just very bad doors), gates (ie. doors), and security guards

### Product/technical
Any security measure that employes technology, though it should be noted that 'technology' is purely vibes-based for the purposes of this definition - locks and keys are technology, relying as they do on a supply chain and technical competence to cut keys very, very finely. But this is the kind of 'technology' that doesn't work with 'magic'.

### Procedural
Rules, regulations, and policies. Staff vetting, security inductions, and the like.
