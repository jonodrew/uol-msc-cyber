Published by [[NIST]], this is the framework against which organisations can evaluate their information security. It's not technically a #standard , though there's an argument to be made that it is an 'unofficial' standard. The catalogue of controls for this standard are held in [[NIST Special Publication 800-53|NIST SP 800-53]]. It is less prespective than [[ISO 27001]].

The framework defines five core functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. The latter three all involve [[contro#Reactive|reactive controls]]. 

## Identify
Users should develop an understanding of the organisation's systems, people, [[asset|assets]], data and capabilities as well as how to manage them.

## Protect
Users should develop an implement 'appropriate' preventive [[security controls]], which in [[NIST]] are called safeguards. These controls should ensure the secure delivery of critical services

## Detect
Users should develop controls to...well, detect, incidents

## Respond
Users should develop controls to maintain resilience and restore any services damaged in an incident.

## Implementation tiers
There are four tiers, from partial (Tier 1) to adaptive (Tier 4)
