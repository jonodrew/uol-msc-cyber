Assets come in as great an array of types as the mechanisms for using them. In information assurance, three main types of assets are considered, although the sub-categories that fall within each of these main types can be numerous. The three main types are:

1.  pure information (in whatever format);
2.  physical assets such as buildings and computer systems;
3. software that is used to process or manage information and data
4. [[Dieter Gollman]], in [[Computer security]], adds "reputation" as another asset

## information assets
Information might be structured or unstructured: stuctured, like a relational database, or unstructured, like memos or written records

They might also vary in location. They may be locally held. They may be backed up to a cloud storage facility, or may even originate there and never touch the user's device.

Information assets can be in transit, or at rest. We protect such information from eavesdropping risks using [[encryption]].
