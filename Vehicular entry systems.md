## What [[security service]] do we need?
|service|detail|
|-------|------|
|[[confidentiality]]|this seems important. If someone can use the data stream to access our vehicle, it should be confidential|
|[[data integrity]]|I'm..honestly not sure|
|[[data origin authentication]]|We probably want to be sure it's coming from our fob, and not any other...|
|[[non-repudiation]]|I feel like this is a no?|
|[[entity authentication]]|Ideally yes, but I'm not sure how...|

## Needs:
- [[entity authentication]]

## Doesn't need:
- [[data integrity]]
- [[confidentiality]]
- [[non-repudiation]]
- [[entity authentication]]
- [[data origin authentication]]
