- [[Private Set Intersections]] are special kind of [[Multi-Party Computation|MPC]], as is [[Threshold Cryptography]]
- slight side eye at [[fully homomorphic encryption]] with this line: "Such an attack can actually be carried out on some encryption schemes (i.e., given an encryption of $100, it is possible to generate a valid encryption of $101, without knowing the original encrypted value)"
