## notes
- will people engage more with security if it's user-friendly?
- callback to [[Computer Security principles and practice#^7a4905|psychological acceptability]] as a principle for security design
- "secure systems have a particularly rich history of indifference to the user"
- "Military multi-level systems (MLS) are prone to 'label float' - information gets overclassified as a by-product of the mismatch between how users produce and use information and how labelling is determined by the MLS model"
- least privilege is a hard principle to make user friendly, because it determines privilege on a task- or thread-based process - and this is not how humans tend to work
- paper suggests we use the standard usability approaches we apply to web design in security
- we can also start with the needs of the user when considering security
- "[[PGP]] has other usability problems" üëàüèª this is what we call an understatement, friends
- security policy should be organised around information content and not 'namespace placement'
- "a coherent, consistent \[user interface] is itself a security tool, not just window dressing"
