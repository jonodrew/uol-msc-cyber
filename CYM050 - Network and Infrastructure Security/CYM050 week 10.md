## Learning objectives
- Define critical infrastructure and its challenges
- Discuss the scope and legal implications of security testing
- Identify security vulnerabilities in computer networks

## Lesson 1: [[penetration testing]]
- guest lecture with [[Darren Hurley-Smith]]
- testing!
	- [[black box]] testing, where we have no information
	- [[grey box]] testing, which is a pathetic copout where we have 'some' (defined by whom?) information
	- [[white box]] testing, where we have a full system spec
		- worth noting that you get what the client thinks is the spec. Do _you_ believe their documentation is good? Have *you* ever written documentation? That's what I thought.
		- Write more documentation, you slacker. Securing your system by not telling anyone how it works is bad development
- when testing, we like to use [[open-source intelligence|OSINT]], because that's where the good stuff often is. People post on StackOverflow with IDs that can be traced back to companies/organisations
- Also, people report bugs in systems publicly! That's super helpful
- We get a gentle reminder that security testing is consensual: unauthorised testing of a system may land you in hot water with the [Computer Misuse Act in the UK](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents)
	- I know it's novel for me to take this tone but the UK Government does not muck around in this area so please do not do this

## Lesson 2: [[critical national infrastructure]]
