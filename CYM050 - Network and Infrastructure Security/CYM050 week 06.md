## Learning objectives
- List common problems in secure communication over insecure networks
- Explain basic concepts of network virtualization
- Define cross-device [[authentication]]

## Introduction
- protocols for [[authentication]] and [[authorisation]]
- technologies to secure network connections, such as [[virtual private network]] or [[virtal local area network]]
- and the security of [[Wi-Fi]]

## Readings
- [[Network Security Essentials#Chapter 4#4.1 Remote user authentication principles]]
- [[Network Security Essentials#Chapter 4#4.2 symmetric key distribution using symmetric symmetric encryption]]
- [[Network Security Essentials#Chapter 4#4.3 Kerberos]]

## Lesson 1
- [[Kerberos]]!
	- OOOF. A lot of detail on Kerberos. Some (me) would say too much
- other [[authentication]] #protocol 
	- [[password authentication protocol]]
	- [[challenge handshake authentication protocol]]
	- these protocols were devised to provide [[authentication]] for the [[point to point protocol]]
- [[tunelling]]
- [[remote authentication dial-in user service|RADIUS]]
- [[IEEE 802.1X]]

## Lesson 2: [[virtual private network]]
- there are VPNs where you have a second factor
