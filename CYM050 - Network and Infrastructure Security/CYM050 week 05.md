## Learning objectives
- Develop a basic configuration for network [[firewall|firewalls]]
- Outline the concept of firewalls
- Summarize how the [[DNS|Domain Name System]] works and to describe its [[integrity]] problem

## Lesson 1: [[DNS]]
- A domain name is unique and is made up of labels, separated by dots. The last label is the [[top-level domain]]. Actually, technically the last label is `.`, which is the root domain. That means all websites are subdomains of `.`
- A domain name may have up to 127 labels, and and each label can contain up to 63 characters
- keeping it secure is a nightmare
