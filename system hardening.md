The process by which we make it harder for an [[attacker]] to attack a system. We do this by reducing the [[attack surface]] as much as we can. For example:
- we change default [[password|passwords]] and enforce strong passwords
- we patch the system
- we limit installation of services (there is a balance here between [[security vs usability]])
- remove unused user accounts
- use [[anti-virus]], [[firewall]], [[intrusion detection system]], and other software to limit intrusions
- limit access to the [[Internet]], if possible
	- again, consider [[security vs usability]]
