Money muling is a process by which illegal money is moved from one place to another, usually via a 'clean' account.

Mules are sent money, and then asked to withdraw it in cash and wire it onwards, often to a different country, while keeping a cut for themselves.

Because the processing of stolen funds is essentially outsourced, the criminal adds a layer of protection to the transfer of funds

[[cryptocurrency]] is particularly valuable here, because there is no central authority to flag 'suspicious' payments. Additionally, there is little personal detail involved in such transactions
