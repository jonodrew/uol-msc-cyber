- researchers actually asked people why they want [[anonymity]] on the [[Internet]]
- 85% of interviewees in one said that they did not know how to surf the [[Internet]] anonymously

	- "a series of tubes"
- [[Gary Marx]] describes seven dimensions of anonymity, such that a person cannot be identified:
	- by their legal name
	- location
	- pseudonyms that can be linked to the person's legal name or location
	- pseudonyms that cannot be linked to specific identity information but that provide other clues to identity
	- revealing patterns of behaviour
	- membership in a social group
	- information, items, or skills that indicate personal characteristics
- no pre-existing hypothesis, so used qualitative interview techniques
- the interviewees personal [[threat model]]s fell into five categories:
	- online predator
	- organisations
	- known others
	- other users in the community
	- unknown others
