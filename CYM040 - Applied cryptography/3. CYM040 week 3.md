## Learning objectives
-   Explain the differences between a [[stream cipher]] and a [[block cipher]], and differentiate their use
-   Identify a number of different stream and block ciphers, and applications using them
-   Compare the historical context behind the development of [[DES]] and [[AES]], and how this influenced their properties and their standardization processes
-   Justify the need for modes of operation of a block cipher
-   Select an appropriate mode of operation for a block cipher application
## 3.1 - [[stream cipher]]
- First things first: read [[Everyday Cryptography#Chapter 4]] up to 4.1
- We then move on to something called a [[Vernam cipher]]. The only thing that can achieve this is a [[one-time pad]]
- more reading: [[Everyday Cryptography#^8d27eb|section 4.2]] of the book
