# Public key management
## Learning objectives
- Compare the challenges associated with key management of symmetric, asymmetric private and asymmetric public keys
- Explain the features and purpose of a public-key certificate
- Compare different techniques for implementing the different phases in the public-key certificate life cycle
- Explain some alternative approaches to public-key management that do not involve certificates
## 8.1 Managing [[asymmetric|asymmetric cryptosystem]] keys
### Providing assurance of purpose of [[public key]]
- read [[Everyday Cryptography#11.1 public key management]]
- then read about [[public-key certificate#Lifecycle]]
- and then go on to [[Everyday Cryptography#11.3 public key management models]]
