## Webinar
### Exam:
- 4 questions, answer 3 of them
	- 1, 2 are mandatory then choose 3 or 4
	- questions will have sub-questions
- 25 marks per question
- 24 hour period for the exam (??)
	- Once you click 'download' on the paper, a timer will start
	- Likely about 2 hours
- past papers?
	- None
- there are now/will be summary documents appearing in the 'resources' section of the coursera space
- sounds like it'll be open book, but we're waiting for confirmation
- will just need to upload a PDF, so any word processing software will be good
- no multiple-choice questions
- pass mark will be around 50%
- everything on the course is examinable

## Reviewing the Big Six
This quiz is HARD.
- Which do not require confidentiality?
	- [[Vehicular entry systems]] (really??) and [[Bitcoin]]
- Which always uses authenticated encryption?
	- [[Wi-Fi]]
- Which usually uses a [[stream cipher]]?
	- [[Mobile phone security]]
- Which use nonce-based [[entity authentication]]?
	- [[Wi-Fi]], [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]], [[Mobile phone security]], [[Vehicular entry systems]]
- Which always need [[digital signature]] schemes?
	- [[Secure email]] and [[Bitcoin]]
- Which support multiple algorithms for the same [[security service]]?
	- Five: only Bitcoin does not
- Which are not specified by standards?
	- [[Secure email]] and [[Vehicular entry systems]] don't have a standard
- Which usually rely on preinstalled, long-term, [[symmetric|symmetric encryption]]?
	- [[Wi-Fi]], [[Mobile phone security]],  [[Vehicular entry systems]]
- Which supports [[ChaCha20Poly1305]]?
	- [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]
- Which supports [[ZUC]]?
	- [[Mobile phone security]]
- Which supports [[CCM mode]]?
	- [[Wi-Fi]]
- Which mandates the use of [[ECDSA]]?
	- [[Bitcoin]]
- What is the most distinctive feature of [[Bitcoin]]?
	- It's mostly about [[data integrity]]
- What is the main distinctive feature of TLS amongst the [[The Big Six]]?
	- Not that it mandates authenticated encryption
	- Not that it requires [[symmetric|symmetric encryption]] and [[asymmetric|asymmetric cryptosystem]]
	- But that it uses almost every cryptographic primitive
- How many are secure against a quantum computer?
	- Not all of them
	- Not even most of them
	- None of them
		- Hmmm
## Peer-reviewed assessment: [[Why the big six?]]
## [[NHS]] contact tracing application
- we're going to read and analyse the white paper [[NHS-app-security-paper V0.1.pdf]]
- It's in the name of [[Ian Levy]], formerly of [[National Cyber Security Centre|NCSC]]
- The paper outlines the requirements of the applications, and also enumerates the kinds of bad actors who might try to misuse it
- It's notable that the bad actors go from people trying to misuse the system for personal gain to nation state actors trying to cause mass panic
	- These people do not fuck around
- There follows an overview of the system architecture
	- The connection to the collecting system is encrypted, and to do so the registration process establishes two symmetric keys
- The app uses public cloud, which seems sensible
