WireGuard is an alternative to existing [[virtual private network|VPN]] technologies. It operates at [[network layer|layer 3]] and aims to replace both [[Internet Protocol Security|IPsec]] and open-source, [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]-based solutions like [[OpenVPN]]. The tunnel is created based on an association between a [[public key]] and a source [[IP address]]. Short pre-shared static keys, which are [[Curve25519]] points, are used for mutual authentication, in the style of [[OpenSSH]]. The [[encryption algorithm]] used is [[ChaCha20Poly1305]]. The author, [[Jason A. Donefeld]], claims that it can be implemented in [[Linux]] in fewer than 4,000 lines of code.
