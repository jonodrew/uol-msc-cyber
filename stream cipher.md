A stream cipher is a [[symmetric|symmetric cryptosystem]] (that is, a means of [[encryption]]) where [[plaintext]] is combined with a [[keystream]]. The keystream is generated by a [[keystream generator]], a deterministic pseudorandom function. The keystream and the plaintext are the inputs to the [[exclusive or|XOR]] function, the output of which is the [[ciphertext]]. 

Given that the method for encrypting data is simply [[exclusive or|XOR]], when we talk about specific stream ciphers we're really talking about a particular [[keystream generator]]. 

To decrypt the ciphertext, the receiver will need the same key and keystream generator. Once they have this they can make use of the property of XOR: running it twice over the same input returns the original input, ie:
>[!note]
>$XOR(XOR(p, k), k) = p$
