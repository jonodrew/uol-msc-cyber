## Code obfuscation
These techniques increase the complexity of the output of assembled and compiled code

## Obfuscation for #privacy
### techniques
- [[anonymisation]]: making the data completely anonymous
- [[Generalisation]]: putting data into brackets or buckets ^90f992
- [[Suppression]]: we simply remove some data in order to protect individual identities ^47d6dd
- Perturbation/[[differential privacy]]: adding a small amount of noise to data, to make it different from the original. In this way you can disguise the data
- Dummy addition: the addition of fake data points. Not really used except in [copyrighting maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_street)
