Full title: Reporting cybercrime victimization: determinants,
motives, and previous experiences

## Introduction
- police struggle to handle cybercrime, but additionally often people do not report cybercrime to the police

## Literature review
- [[neoclassical economics]] strikes again: much existing literature examines the likelihood of (not) reporting through the lens of cost-benefit analysis
- an existing relationship to the perpetrator has an impact on likelihood of reporting
- male victims are more likely to report cybercrime to law enforcement than female victims - the opposite of the case with non-cyber crime

## Method
- surveys are still hard; older men with higher incomes are once again over-represented
