WannaCry is [[ransomware]]. The most well known attack from WannaCry affected the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[NHS]].

230,000 computers globally were attacked in May 2017. This attack was eventually attributed to [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea|DPRK]].

The NHS was a particularly good target because each trust manages its own IT, and in many places patching is not carried out at pace. 

This incident is the only Tier 2 cyber attack that the [[National Cyber Security Centre|NCSC]] has had to deal with. There have been no Tier 1 attacks since the founding its founding.
