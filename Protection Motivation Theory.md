## notes
- individuals are motivated to respond to warnings about threats, which are called fear appeals in the literature
- when appraising an fear appeal, people will consider three factors:
	- rewards or benefits of ignoring the warning
	- the (perceived) severity of the threat
	- the (perceived) vulnerability of the individual
- additionally, there are three factors that people will consider to cope with, or manage, the threat:
	- the efficacy or benefits of removing the threat
	- the cost of removing the threat
	- the belief of the individual in their capacity to implement a protective behaviour
- As an outcome, the targeted population may adopt a defensive stance, rejecting the message and sometimes even taking the opposite action
