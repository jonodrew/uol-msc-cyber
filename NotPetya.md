Part of the [[Petya]] family of [[malware]]

Although NotPetya seems like [[ransomware]], it is more akin to a [[wiper]]. This is because the authors did not bother with a decryption mechanism. That is, once files are encrypted with NotPetya, there is no way of getting them back.

NotPetya uses a vulnerability developed by the [[NSA]] called [[EternalBlue]]. It also has a capability to harvest user credentials, enabling propagation across a [[network]].

Some argue that NotPetya was a politically-motivated weapon deployed by [[Russia]] against [[Ukraine]]. One indication is that NotPetya specifically used a compromised piece of software called M.E.Doc. M.E.Doc is software used for tax calculations in Ukraine. Additionally, the attack came the day before Constitution Day in Ukraine. If this was the case, it seems targeted at Ukrainian infrastructure.
