Child sexual abuse materials are images or videos showing indencent images of children. Their production and dissemination is a crime in almost all jurisdictions.

Child sexual abuse material is typically produced in the victim's domestic environment and most often by those in the child's circle of trust ([[A corrupting influence]], pp. 42)

### Distinction from pornography
Pornography is the legal production of obscene images or videos of consenting adults. Children cannot consent to obscene acts, and therefore the phrase "child pornography" is incorrect and should not be used.
