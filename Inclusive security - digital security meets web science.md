## Chapter 1: Introduction

## 3.3 Usable security
- ref [[User-centred security]]
- ref [[Users are not the enemy]]
- there is an overhead to complying with complex security rules that do not _seem_ to support the tasks that users are trying to carry out
- an economic lens is valuable but somewhat unfocussed. It risks lumping everyone into one category
- 'insider threat' is a false binary: we consider people 'inside' and 'outside' based on trust, and the level of trust we have in them should be a continuum
	- this feels almost like a continuation, or different approach, to [[zero-trust architecture]]
