These are anomalies we look for when investigating an incident. They might include:
- detection of network prones, signature ([[cryptographic hash function|hash]]) matches
- unusual connections, protocols, transitions
- increased log data
- unexpected authentication/access
- performance issues, including crashes (hackers often write lazy, memory-leaking software)
- unfamiliar processes
- file permission/size changes
- log files that are incomplete or missing
