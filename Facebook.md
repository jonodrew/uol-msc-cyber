A social media site that has been subject to fines and criticism due to its connection to [[Cambridge Analytica]]

## Background
Facebook exposes a series of application programming interfaces, APIs, to developers of third party software. One of these is called the 'Graph' API, and it allows developers to interact with users and read certain pieces of information about them.

Giving a third party application permission to read your data was not well signposted, and the permissions granted were often wider than users might have suspected

## Graph API v1
This version of the API allowed users to grant an app permission to view not only their data, but the data of their friends.

[![Everyone disliked that.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/472/561/e3e.png)](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/472/561/e3e.png "Everyone Disliked That Template")

## Graph API v2
Realising perhaps that handing out user data like water at a rave was going to get it into trouble, Facebook/Meta started to develop a new version of the Graph API. However, to allow a smooth transition, it gave app developers a one-year transition period.

## Your Digital Life
A company called Global Science Research, or GSR, developed an app called 'Your Digital Life'. It comprised a detailed personality test, and also soaked up the data of the user's friends, as well as the data of the user themselves.

This included (stars and stones, the length of this list):
- name
- data of birth
- gender
- current city
- photographs in which the user was tagged
- pages the user liked
- posts the user had made
- their list of friends
- and the same data for their friends *what the fuck*
The total number of users whose data was accessed by the app was estimated at 87 million people.

## Cambridge Analytica
They commissioned a company called Qualtrics to find and pay members of the public to use the app.

They paid them less than one USD.

## Fines from the [[Information Commissionerâ€™s Office|ICO]]
- Facebook contacted Cambridge Analytica and asked them to delete the data, and the data derived from it
- The ICO served a warrant on Cambridge Analytica and recovered servers, mobile phones, and other devices from the offices
- They also discovered disconnected and damaged servers, and employees admitted that not all models had been deleted

## Federal Trade Commission ([[US]])
- In July 2019 the FTC announced a 5 billion USD settlement with Facebook after a parallel investigation of the above
- Facebook also agreed to up user protections
