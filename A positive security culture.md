## notes
- a positive security culture is a 'just' security culture
- a just security culture is:
>[!quote] A just culture is a culture of trust, learning and accountability. A just culture is particularly important when an incident has occurred, when something has gone wrong. How do you respond to the people involved? How do you minimise the negative impact and maximise learning?

- this is apparently well-established in 'safety related fields' (who they?)
- requires a reporting structure
	- make it easy to report
	- make reporting voluntary
	- protect people's identities
	- keep people informed
	- highlight the benefits
- accountability is not the same as blame!
	- blame is a power-over dynamic
	- accountability is an individual taking responsibility for their role in a complex failure
