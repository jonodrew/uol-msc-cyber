alias: [NIST SP 800-53]
---
A catalogue of controls for use alongside the [[NIST Cyber Security Framework]]. The [[NIST]] equivalent of [[ISO 27002|ISO/IEC 27002]].

The controls are divided into 20 families (!), and the catalogue itself runs to 450 pages. This grouping is functional, rather than operational.

The scope of this catalogue includes privacy, with 27002 does not.
