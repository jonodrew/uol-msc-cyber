### Scenario: civil war
The nearby imperialistic superpower has decided to show off in front of the other superpower, probably because the other superpower has been ignoring it. To achieve this, they've launched a devastating series of attacks that have reduced the western side of your country to rubble, entirely destroying one of the regional offices and killing every member of staff working there. Your own country has declared martial law and is calling up every able-bodied woman to join its armed forces. Men, being overly-emotional and unable to deal effectively with pain or blood, are left to take care of 'business'. This has reduced the workforce in the remaining offices by one half. However, staff are still permitted to attend offices.

### Critical ICT functions at risk
1. Staff: we have fewer staff now. Those that are left suffer from sleep deprivation, as air-raid warnings go off at 2 or 3am each morning. This has impacts on the operational efficiency of the ICT function
2. Network integrity: although one of the offices has been destroyed, it's possible an [[attacker]] has recovered a network switch from the rubble
3. Information confidentiality: the attack is occuring not just in the physical theatre, but also by digital means
### Controls impacted
From [[ISO 27002|ISO/IEC 27002]]:
1. 5.2: Information Security roles and responsibilities
2. 6.8: Information security event reporting
3. 7.7: **Clear desk and clear screen**: when the air raid sirens go off, folks get out of their offices in a hurry. They try to remember to lock their devices, but papers are unlikely to be tidied away
