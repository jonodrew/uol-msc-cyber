How to protect "sensitive" identities
Classes:
- royals, celebrities, witness protection -> false name, but link back to individual
- spooky people (out of scope, but pattern might be re-usable...)

current process:
- person-to-person communication with authentication managed through existing relationships

New challenges:
- facial detection
- AI identification of sensitive identities - profiles that are unconnected to anyone, and seem to exist in isolation, are functionally similar to fraudulent identities

Existing challenges:
- metadata: a big flag over a regular identity that says "This is sensitive!" gives the game away
- so how do you give sensitive identities the qualities of a regular identity, except in certain circumstances?
