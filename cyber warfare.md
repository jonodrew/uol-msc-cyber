I'm really interested by the reference to an international organization here, because it goes further than (I think) an historical view of war. Can organizations declare and conduct wars? Was the East India Company waging a war? 

Using this definition, the actors could be [[nation-state]], patriots hobbyists, [[terrorist]]s, [[hacktivist]], [[cyber criminal]], or even [[insider]] - though I think that is more likely to be a [[nation-state]] agent who's carried out [[HUMINT]] and employed an agent.

## Manifestations
- subversion: undermining the target nation's government, culture, or society
- espionage: accessing classified data to nullify a competitor's advantage
- sabotage: deliberately damaging or disrupting the normal processes, functions, or production of a target. Can be achieved through throwing clogs at machines
These manifestations are all part of traditional warfare, and are [[cyber-enabled]]. Contrast with [[electronic warfare]] and consider the [[force-multiplier]] offered to [[information warfare]].
