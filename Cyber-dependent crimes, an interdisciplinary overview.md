## Abstract
Online crime has increased in severity and frequency over the past two decades. However, although several scientific disciplines have commonly employed criminological theories to explain this phenomenon, mainstream criminology has devoted relatively scant attention to the investigation of cyber-criminals and their victims. Drawing on this assumption that more criminological attention should be given to this important type of crime, this article presents an interdisciplinary review of the current state of research on cyber-dependent crimes (i.e., crimes that require the use of computer technology to exist, such as hacking). We begin with a brief discussion of the ecosystem of cyber-dependent crimes and the key actors who operate within it, including the online offenders and enablers, targets and victims, and guardians. Next, we review empirical scholarship that pertains to each actor while  distinguishing between nontheoretical research and theoretically driven studies. We then detail  methodological and theoretical avenues that should be pursued by future research and discuss why criminological research should lead policy initiatives and guide the design of technical tools that improve the scientific communityâ€™s ability to generate a safer and more secure cyber-environment. We conclude by discussing potential ways in which cyber-dependent crime research could pave the way for the advancement of mainstream criminological theory and research

## Notes
- this is specifically about cyber-dependent crime
- an ecosystem is the interacting biotic community and its environment (Dunlap & Catton 1979)
- we can apply this model to criminal behaviour and identify the following species:
	- criminals
	- enablers
	- targets
	- guardians
- the most common criminological theories to be applied to explain the causes (etiology) of cyber-dependent crime are:
	- General Theory of Crime (Gottfredson & Hirschi 1990)
	- Social Learning (Akers 1973)
	- Social control (Hirschi 1969 and particularly Sykes & Matza's techniques of neutralisation \[1957])
	- deterrence theories (Gibbs 1975)
