Although this is presented as a theory, in actuality it is a hypothesis
## Postulates
1. People who repress criminal urges in physical space, due to social standing, can express them in cyberspace
2. Identity flexibility, dissociative anonymity, and lack of deterrence in cyberspace lower the barriers to committing crime
3. There will be movement of criminality between the physical and cyber spaces, because fundamentally the individual committing the crime is still the same person
4. I can't track this one at all - "Intermittent ventures of offenders in to the cyberspace and the dynamic spatio-temporal nature of cyberspace provide the chance to escape. "
5. In cyberspace, bonds can be formed quickly with strangers in order to commit crimes. Additionally, existing relationships transition easily into cyberspace, enabling criminals to bring associates from the physical space into the cyber space
6. Closed (repressive?) societies are more likely to generate criminals than open societies
7. The norms and values of physical spaces may conflict with the norms and values of cyber spaces, and in this conflict cyber crime may arise
