Security failures, i.e. cases where cyber security management has clearly failed, are the focus of this week. The nature of security breaches and failures is initially discussed, given that breaches will occur in all organisations no matter how well-managed. Two well-known examples are discussed and analysed. The implications of these case studies are explored, notably the need to prepare for, and react effectively to, security breaches.

### Learning Objectives

---

- Contribute to the planning and design of appropriate sets of responses to security breaches
- Analyse security breaches, and learn appropriate lessons
- Distinguish between security breaches and security failures

## Reading
- [[UK Government Cyber Security Breaches Survey (2022)]]
- [[Information security management principles#Chapter 8 Disaster recovery and business continuity management]] 
- [[National Cyber Security Centre|NCSC]]'s [[Cyber Assessment Framework]]: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf

## Lesson 1: Why study failures?

>[!question] Should we encourage organisations to report security breaches?
>
>Yes: it offers everyone a chance to learn, and improves trust through transparency. This behaviour should be encouraged, but is often squashed by fear that there will be further punishment

- there is often regulation to report breaches to regulators, but not the public
- is a security breach (defined as a compromise of any of the [[CIA triad]]) always a failure of the [[information security management system|ISMS]]?

## Lesson 2: [[NotPetya]] and [[MÃ¦rsk]]
- new focus on recovery within 24hrs
- company adopted [[NIST]] framework
- implemented a risk-based approach to cybersecurity
- reconsidered approach to monitoring
- better modelling of business processes and thereby identify weaknesses in the [[attack surface]]
