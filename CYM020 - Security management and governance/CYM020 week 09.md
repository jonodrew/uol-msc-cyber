Security failures, i.e. cases where cyber security management has clearly failed, are the focus of this week. The nature of security breaches and failures is initially discussed, given that breaches will occur in all organisations no matter how well-managed. Two well-known examples are discussed and analysed. The implications of these case studies are explored, notably the need to prepare for, and react effectively to, security breaches.
