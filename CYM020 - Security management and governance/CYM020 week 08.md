Corporate control and audit form the focus of this week. Initially the notion and importance of control are explored; this is followed by an introduction to the [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission]] model. This leads naturally to a discussion of audit and the various types of audit that can be performed, together with developing an understanding of why audits are so important. One particular type of audit, namely the compliance audit, is examined in grater detail.

### Learning Objectives

- internal control is a management process designed to provide reasonable assurance on achieving objectives in the following three dimensions:
	- effectivenes and efficiency of operations;
	- reliability of financial reporting;
	- compliance with applicable laws and regulations
- internal control is a means to an end and not an end in itself
- the work of the [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission|COSO]] is very influential in this area
- the key five areas it describes are:
	- the control environment, which is the foundation for internal control
	- [[risk assessment]]
	- control activities
	- information and communication
	- monitoring
- internal control is not infallible
	- what is!?!
- the report that generated the five areas above was updated in 2013
- in it, 17 key principles were added
- note that [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission#Internal control|section 1 of the COSO report]] aligns closely to the management clause of [[ISO 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]].
