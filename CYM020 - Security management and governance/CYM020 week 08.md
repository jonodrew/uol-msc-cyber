Corporate control and audit form the focus of this week. Initially the notion and importance of control are explored; this is followed by an introduction to the [[COSO]] model. This leads naturally to a discussion of audit and the various types of audit that can be performed, together with developing an understanding of why audits are so important. One particular type of audit, namely the compliance audit, is examined in grater detail.
