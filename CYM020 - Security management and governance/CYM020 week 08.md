Corporate control and audit form the focus of this week. Initially the notion and importance of control are explored; this is followed by an introduction to the [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission]] model. This leads naturally to a discussion of audit and the various types of audit that can be performed, together with developing an understanding of why audits are so important. One particular type of audit, namely the compliance audit, is examined in grater detail.

### Learning Objectives

---

- Judge which types of audit are most appropriate for an organisation
- Plan approaches to compliance audits
- Evaluate the effectiveness of controls with an organisation
## Lesson 1: The notion of control in a business

>[!quote] Internal control is a process, effected by an entityâ€™s board of directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives relating to operations, reporting, and compliance.

- internal control is a management process designed to provide reasonable assurance on achieving objectives in the following three dimensions:
	- effectivenes and efficiency of operations;
	- reliability of financial reporting;
	- compliance with applicable laws and regulations
- internal control is a means to an end and not an end in itself
- the work of the [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission|COSO]] is very influential in this area
- the key five areas it describes are:
	- the control environment, which is the foundation for internal control
	- [[risk assessment]]
	- control activities
	- information and communication
	- monitoring
- internal control is not infallible
	- what is!?!
- the report that generated the five areas above was updated in 2013
- in it, 17 key principles were added
- note that [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission#Internal control|section 1 of the COSO report]] aligns closely to the management clause of [[ISO 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]].

## Lesson 2: What is audit, and why do it?
- ðŸš¨reading from the dictionary alertðŸš¨
- external financial audits check that the accounts are as they're supposed to be, and is generally performed by an independent accountant
- internal control audits check that 'adequate' internal control is in place, and is performed by an organisation's internal audit function
- security audits can be performed internally or externally, and are concerned with security controls
- Auditors should be trustworthy, straightforward, honest, fair, candid, and comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law
- The Financial Reporting Council (UK) sets out the principles of integrity, objectivity, and independence

## Lesson 3: Types of audits
- all audits only provide a point-in-time understanding of what they're auditing
- they're also vulnerable to negative environmental pressures on human actors, such as fear of punishment (for doing badly) or reward (bonus contingent on passing the audit)
- penetration tests are a form of audit
