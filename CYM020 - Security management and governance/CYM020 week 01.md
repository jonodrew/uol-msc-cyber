This preliminary week introduces key concepts that are developed further in the remainder of the module, including an understanding of what an [[information security management system]] is and the role it plays in Cyber Security Management (CSM) within an organisation. The key standards-setting bodies are introduced, as are key notions such as security threat, security risk and security control. Finally, the role of people in ensuring cyber security is highlighted.

### Learning Objectives

---

-   Define the role of an [[information security management system]] within an organisation
-   Explain the key role played by people in Cyber Security Management
-   Identify security [[threat|threats]] and [[risk|risks]]
-   Describe the role of #standard within Cyber Security Management

## Readings
Books for this course are:
- [[Information security management principles]]
- [[Cyber Security (A Practitioner's Guide)]]
- [[Information Security Management]]

## Lesson 1: What is cyber security management?
- oh hey, it's [[Chris Mitchell]]
- it's about reducing the [[impact]] of [[attack|attacks]]
- Cyber security management is about managing the [[security controls]] that should protect against attacks. There are:
	- technical
	- procedural (security policies, vetting, logging, auditing)
- 'people are the foundation on which cyber security is built' 
- for our purposes, cyber security means maintaining the [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]] of information (the so-called [[CIA triad]])
- we don't do this for fun, but for the sake of the organisation (which means taking a risk/reward based approach to security!)
- just because everyone knows the basics, doesn't mean we can wave away the need for proper, systematic management

>[!question] What's the first thing to consider when developing a systematic approach to cybersecurity?
>You must understand:
>- the [[risk]] to the organisation
>- the kind of [[threat]]
>- the [[risk appetite]] of the organisation

- Before we can assess risk to assets, we need to understand what the [[asset|assets]] actually are. Chris argues that all assets should have an asset owner. This is a good thing to aim for, but 'asset' is a very fuzzy term and consequently finding an owner for each broadly defined thing is difficult.
- Your [[information security management system|ISMS]] should be a dynamic, 'living' document that's updated when the threat landscape changes.
>[!question] To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
>
>To ensure the CIA of information assets it is typically necessary to implement a wide range of security controls. Selection, implementation and ongoing configuration and management of these controls typically requires detailed technical knowledge. As a result, and bearing in mind that many threats arise from issues relating to software, it is essential that **all** members of staff with responsibility for cyber security have a detailed understanding of information technology and security, including extensive programming experience.

This statement is provocative. First, let's consider who has responsibility for 'cyber security'. The answer might well be everyone. Even the least-technical member of staff is responsible for reporting [[phishing attacks]] and _not_ plugging random USB devices into their machines. Alternatively, the only person really responsible for cyber-security is the CEO or equivalent - and they probably don't have a technical background. The Board will probably agree that it's not necessary?

So what's the answer? Simple. Cyber-security is everyone's responsibility, and for a select group of people it's their full-time job. That job is advancing, improving, and shifting security so that's it becomes a utility.

## Lesson 2: #standard and cyber security
- In [[International Standards Organisation|ISO]] standards:
	- 'shall' means "required for compliance with the standard"
	- "should" means "recommended but not required for compliance with the standard"
