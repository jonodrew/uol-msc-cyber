This week is concerned with the management of cyber security risks. Risk management forms the foundation for both the [[ISO 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]] and [[NIST]] security frameworks. The [[ISO 31000|ISO/IEC ISO 31000]]  model for risk management is introduced, and the key steps are discussed. The key steps or  risk assessment and risk treatment are then examined in greater detail. The week concludes with a review of a simple worked example of the risk assessment and treatment processes.

## Lesson 1: What is [[risk management]]?
- before you can manage a risk, padawan, you must understand what a [[risk]] is
- Before you can understand a risk, you must comprehend...a [[threat]]!
- definitions are valuable, because they delineate responsibilities and ensure we have nice clear silos
- Risks must be associated with an information asset. For example: having a weak password is not a risk. It might be a [[vulnerability]], and the vulnerability could be exploited to damage an [[asset]] - and herein lies the risk.
- consider also the difference between hostile acts and acts of nature. Can you consider climate change a threat?
- Are we now ready to manage risk?
- No! First we must consider the nature of the assets that are at risk
- ðŸš¨ there is no clear boundary between the inside and outside of an organisation any more! ðŸš¨
