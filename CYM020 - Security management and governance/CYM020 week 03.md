This week is concerned with the management of cyber security risks. Risk management forms the foundation for both the [[ISO 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]] and [[NIST]] security frameworks. The [[ISO 31000|ISO/IEC ISO 31000]]  model for risk management is introduced, and the key steps are discussed. The key steps or  risk assessment and risk treatment are then examined in greater detail. The week concludes with a review of a simple worked example of the risk assessment and treatment processes.
