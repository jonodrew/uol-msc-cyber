This week explores the core legal and regulatory landscape for security management, and the associated management of risk across different jurisdictions. In addition to the concept of a compliant culture, the week will explore more complex debates on the emergent debate on the ethics of security management and how this can be generative of positive security cultures that are beneficial to security management processes.

### Learning Objectives

---

- Appraise how positive security cultures can aid in the practical implementation of an [[information security management system|ISMS]]
- Evaluate the varying ethical discussions and debates regarding security management
- Identify the key legal and regulatory compliance required for an ISMS.

## Lesson 1: Regulation
- not necessary the law, but also those rules put in place by regulators
	- but don't regulators operate with the full force of the law? Is this the difference between criminality and regulatory malpractice?
- we're back on [[Green Accountancy Services]]!

>
>- In the EU, every state will have implemented GDPR. This is regulation around personal information.
>- Because it's an accountany firm, the firm will also be subject to anti-money laundering regulations
>- They will also be responsible under EU law for securing client data against [[attacker]]
>- To receive payments for their services, they may need to follow [[PCI DSS]]
>- They might need to follow regulation around copyright and licensing - for example, they'll probably need licenses for the software they run
>- Finally, at time of writing, they will be under regulation not to sell their services into Russia

- the law changes slowly, while regulation should try to keep pace with the real world
