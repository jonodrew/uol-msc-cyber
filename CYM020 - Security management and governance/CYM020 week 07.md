This week explores the core legal and regulatory landscape for security management, and the associated management of risk across different jurisdictions. In addition to the concept of a compliant culture, the week will explore more complex debates on the emergent debate on the ethics of security management and how this can be generative of positive security cultures that are beneficial to security management processes.

### Learning Objectives

---

- Appraise how positive security cultures can aid in the practical implementation of an [[information security management system|ISMS]]
- Evaluate the varying ethical discussions and debates regarding security management
- Identify the key legal and regulatory compliance required for an ISMS.

- [[Accessible and Inclusive Cyber Security - a nuanced and complex challenge]]
- [[How to build a culture of cybersecurity]]

## Lesson 1: Regulation
- not necessary the law, but also those rules put in place by regulators
	- but don't regulators operate with the full force of the law? Is this the difference between criminality and regulatory malpractice?
- we're back on [[Green Accountancy Services]]!

>[!question] What types of regulation could apply to [[Green Accountancy Services]]?
>
>- In the EU, every state will have implemented GDPR. This is regulation around personal information.
>- Because it's an accountany firm, the firm will also be subject to anti-money laundering regulations
>- They will also be responsible under EU law for securing client data against [[attacker]]
>- To receive payments for their services, they may need to follow [[PCI DSS]]
>- They might need to follow regulation around copyright and licensing - for example, they'll probably need licenses for the software they run
>- Finally, at time of writing, they will be under regulation not to sell their services into Russia

- the law changes slowly, while regulation should try to keep pace with the real world
>[!question] In the UK, what is the impact of at least one regulation upon an ISMS?
>
>In the UK, a breach of personal data must be reported to the [[Information Commissioner’s Office]] within 72 hours of detection. This timeline, and the information that the regulator requires, will need to be factored into the ISMS.

## Lesson 2: Legal duties

>[!question] Make note of three ways in which states can have an impact upon security governance and management
>
>1. Through the passage of legislation that impacts how we do our jobs
>2. Through their management of the economy, which impacts our supply chains, the availability of labour, etc
>3. Through their management of international relations, which might impact our international supply chains and supply of labour

- even though we may not be situated in the [[EU]], we may still need to be aware of EU data regulations - because it rules over the data of EU citizens, even outside the EU
- and consequently, many companies have unilaterially adopted [[GDPR]], even when they're not headquartered there
>[!question] “The growth of ‘extraterritorial’ prescriptive jurisdiction is a threat to effective and holistic cyber security management and governance”. Discuss
>
>Prescriptive jurisdiction is the power to regulate an activity and to prescribe certain behaviours. The growth of extra-territorial prescriptive jurisdiction - that is, the power of a state to regulate an activity beyond its own borders - is a threat not only to effective and holistic cyber security management, but to the free exercise of democratic power.
>
>It can be argued that good laws are good laws, regardless of where they're made. We might also argue that laws that protect the data of citizens are good laws. Thus, the EU's GDPR directive 'improving' the data security of the citizens of India, for example, could be considered a net positive. Moreover, free market conditions can be applied: if Indian companies don't want the headache of coming under the regulations of the GDPR, they can simply 'choose' not to carry out any business in the EU. Alternatively, if they do engage, the EU provides significant amounts of support in the form of guidance in multiple european languages.
>
>However, this extra-territorial overreach has another name: colonialism. The idea that the EU knows best how to regulate data, and is empowered to punish organisations that do not conform to their standards, is an idea rooted in white supremacy. Professionals attempting to develop an ISMS in countries that have EU-based customers must now understand law in an entirely different context, in a different language. This results in the opposite of a holistic system - instead, we end up with a system that tries to blend local laws with that of a far-off trading bloc.
## Lesson 3: Ethics

- Should we apply ethics beyond the law?
- "Ethics could be an entire module of this Masters programme" and yet it's not. Isn't that interesting.
- Ethics is the application of moral principles to our choices
- Such principles often align with legal and regulatory requirements *\[citation needed]*, but they often exceed these and will vary both culturally and politically
>[!question] Describe at least four elements of ethics in cyber security
>
>1. reduction of harm
>2. Accountability
>3. Respect for the individual
>4. Power with, not power over

Here's a case study: a supermarket loyalty scheme
- basically: selling your data. You get cash, they get everything you've ever bought and can build a perfect profile of you based on that
- is it illegal?
- is it ethical?

## Lesson 4: Developing positive cultures

>[!question] 'Positive security cultures **cannot** be produced by ICT security teams alone.' Discuss
>
>Positive security cultures are based on security cultures, and security culture is a part of the general, wider culture. An ICT team can do its best to work towards a positive security culture, but it can be support or frustrated by:
>- a culture of blame
>- a culture of fear
>- a culture of suspicion
>- or indeed a culture of invincibility!
>  
>All of these other cultural elements are outside the control of the ICT team. Asking if the ICT team can solely produce positive security cultures removes the huge influence that other departments, and wider society, has on our work cultures.
