This week concerns how security management can be used to address and respond to security incidents through a range of techniques. This includes engaging with [[ISO 27035]] to develop a pragmatic response to risk management. This includes how to identify and prioritise incidents, their planning and preparation, responding to incidents as well as learning and assessing from (inevitable) incidents that organisations encounter.
