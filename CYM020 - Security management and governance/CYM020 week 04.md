This week is concerned about the integration of different people and communities into security management. It looks at a range of components ranging from trust to security awareness training to demonstrate why the management of people is a core element to a successful information security management system. The week concludes by asking what people-centric security might enable for an organisation and how such a change of perspective can be beneficial to security management.
