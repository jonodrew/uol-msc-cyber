This week is concerned about the integration of different people and communities into security management. It looks at a range of components ranging from trust to security awareness training to demonstrate why the management of people is a core element to a successful information security management system. The week concludes by asking what people-centric security might enable for an organisation and how such a change of perspective can be beneficial to security management.

### Learning Objectives

---

- Develop an appreciation of the different types of people and how to manage competing interests in an [[information security management system|ISMS]]
- Identify and implement different controls for the management of people in organisations
- Evaluate the impact of integration of people-centric security into an ISMS

## Lesson 1: why focus on people?
>[!question] Choose one [[control]] you have studied in the past three weeks and describe how people are important \[within it]
>
>There are only 8 controls in the [[ISO 27002#People|people family of security controls in ISO 27002]]. However, many controls that are not specifically about people involve people. As a very small example, consider controls around password complexity. The user should be able to remember the password and be able to differentiate it from other passwords they know. This is no small task!
