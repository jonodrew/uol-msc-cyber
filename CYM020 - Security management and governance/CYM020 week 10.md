This week brings all the different components of an [[information security management system|ISMS]] together to consider what the balances of security are required for effective security management in organisations. This week will then practically explore how to engage with different ISMS standards, how to interpret them, and the tailoring that is required. It will conclude with an evaluation of how to assess risk and the mitigations required to control it through a blend of scientific methods and an understanding of people.
