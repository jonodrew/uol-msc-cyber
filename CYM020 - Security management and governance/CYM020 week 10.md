This week brings all the different components of an [[information security management system|ISMS]] together to consider what the balances of security are required for effective security management in organisations. This week will then practically explore how to engage with different ISMS standards, how to interpret them, and the tailoring that is required. It will conclude with an evaluation of how to assess risk and the mitigations required to control it through a blend of scientific methods and an understanding of people.

### Learning Objectives

---

- Express the competing priorities in addressing risk and their implications for security management
- Apply the principles learnt across the module to ISMS in context
- Compose an overview to the various aspects of an ISMS41

>[!question] Write an [[ISO 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]] statement for an organisation that you've found online

## Systems thinking
- Oh I have Big Feelings about this
>[!quote] \[thinking about cybersecurity as a system] enables us to break down and piece together what can be different aspects of a diverse organization. In simple terms, it permits us to literally put into place processes, controls, and technologies. In other words, it allows us to systematize cybersecurity. It gives us order...

- foolishness
- Thinking about cybersecurity as a system allows us to apply [[sytems thinking]] and examine its complexity and the feedback loops within it
- It does not give us order
- Systems are not ordered
- Shrinking from the complex, high-entropy nature of systems is an abdication of responsibility

>[!question] “In the future, science will provide near-perfect security management and governance”. Discuss

>At no point in the literature has this been suggested to be true. Indeed, in almost every reading, the opposite is the case: that breaches and failures of security systems come from systemic failures that are rooted in human behaviour. Science could solve these human behavioural problems, for example by eliminating capitalism, but even then - perhaps not.

>Because security is the bounding of a relationship between an attacker and a defender. Science cannot prevent attackers being created. Thus, there will always be attackers. And there will always be means to route around any advanced scientific response.
