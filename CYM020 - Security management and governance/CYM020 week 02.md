This week is concerned with standards for approaches to, and techniques used in, cyber security management. The key standards-making bodies are introduced, as are the most significant cyber security management standards. The use and contents of two particularly important cyber security management frameworks are explored, namely [[ISO 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]] and the [[NIST]] Security Framework. In the last part of this week, the compliance and certification process for ISO/IEC 27001 is introduced.
