This week is concerned with standards for approaches to, and techniques used in, cyber security management. The key standards-making bodies are introduced, as are the most significant cyber security management standards. The use and contents of two particularly important cyber security management frameworks are explored, namely [[ISO 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]] and the [[NIST]] Security Framework. In the last part of this week, the compliance and certification process for ISO/IEC 27001 is introduced.

### Learning Objectives

---

-   Evaluate the appropriateness of security management frameworks for an organisation
-   Create security policies underlying an ISMS
-   Contribute to the development of an Information Security Management System (ISMS), in line with the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001, and evaluate its suitability

## reading
- [[Information security management principles#Chapter 3]]
- Clause 5 of the [[ISO 27000]]


## Lesson 1: an overview of security management #standard 
- we quickly review the [[NIST Cyber Security Framework]] and [[NIST Special Publication 800-53]]
- we also touch on [[Cyber Essentials]]
- also note [[ISO 27701]], which is a #standard that explains how to apply [[ISO 27001]] to protect privacy
- How would you choose between NIST and 27001?
	- Depends whether you need certification, but also how mature the security function is within the organisation
- Then we get into [[Cyber Essentials]]

## Lesson 2: Deep dive on the [[International Standards Organisation|ISO]] frameworks
- [[ISO 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]
- [[ISO 27002|ISO/IEC 27002]]
- A reminder that security policies should be in line with the organisation's wider objectives:
	- "We will enforce need to know" is at odds with "We will let teams experiment with data to find new solutions", unless you redefine "need to know" as "everyone needs to know" - in which case what's the point of the policy?
- [[Statement of Applicability]]

## Lesson 3: [[NIST Cyber Security Framework]]
