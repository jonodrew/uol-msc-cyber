This week is concerned with standards for approaches to, and techniques used in, cyber security management. The key standards-making bodies are introduced, as are the most significant cyber security management standards. The use and contents of two particularly important cyber security management frameworks are explored, namely [[ISO 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]] and the [[NIST]] Security Framework. In the last part of this week, the compliance and certification process for ISO/IEC 27001 is introduced.

### Learning Objectives

---

-   Evaluate the appropriateness of security management frameworks for an organisation
-   Create security policies underlying an ISMS
-   Contribute to the development of an Information Security Management System (ISMS), in line with the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001, and evaluate its suitability

## reading
- [[Information security management principles#Chapter 3]]
- Clause 5 of the [[ISO 27000]]


## Lesson 1: an overview of security management #standard 
- we quickly review the [[NIST Cyber Security Framework]] and [[NIST Special Publication 800-53]]
- we also touch on [[Cyber Essentials]]
- also note [[ISO 27701]], which is a #standard that explains how to apply [[ISO 27001]] to protect privacy
- How would you choose between NIST and 27001?
	- Depends whether you need certification, but also how mature the security function is within the organisation
- Then we get into [[Cyber Essentials]]

## Lesson 2: Deep dive on [[ISO 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]
