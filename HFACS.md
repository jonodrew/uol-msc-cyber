## Abstract
Human error has been implicated in 70 to 80% of all civil and military aviation accidents. Yet, most accident reporting systems are not designed around any theoretical framework of human error. As a result, most accident databases are not conducive to a traditional human error analysis, making the identification of intervention strategies onerous. What is required is a general human error framework around which new investigative methods can be designed and existing accident databases restructured. Indeed, a comprehensive human factors analysis and classification system (HFACS) has recently been developed to meet those needs. Specifically, the HFACS framework has been used within the military, commercial, and general aviation sectors to systematically examine underlying human causal factors and to improve aviation accident investigations. This paper describes the development and theoretical underpinnings of HFACS in the hope that it will help safety professionals reduce the aviation accident rate through systematic, data-driven investment strategies and objective evaluation of intervention programs

## Model
1. Unsafe acts
	1. Errors
		1. Decision
		2. Skill-based
		3. Perceptual
	4. Violations
		1. Routine
		2. Exceptional
3. Preconditions for unsafe acts
	1. Substandard operator conditions
		1. Adverse mental state
		2. Adverse physiological state
		3. Physical/mental limitations
	2. Substandard operator practices
		1. Crew resource mismanagement
		2. Personal readiness
3. Unsafe supervision
	1. Inadequate supervision
	2. Planned inappropriate operations
	3. Failed to correct problem
	4. Supervisory violations
5. Organisational influences
	1. Resource management
	2. Organisational climate
	3. Organisational process
## Notes
- Paper establishes up front that 'accidents cannot be attributed to a single cause, or in most instances, even a single individual'
- 'even the identification of a "primary" cause is fraught with problems'
- [[Swiss Cheese model#Reason model|Reason 'Swiss cheese' model]] of human error is a valuable theory, and this paper attempts to apply it using 300 Naval aviation accidents
- Unsafe acts (layer 1 of the model) is subdivided into errors and violations
	- errors are further divided into errors of:
		- decision
		- skill
		- perception
	- violations are divided into:
		- routine violations
		- exceptional violations
- paper notes that when violations are routine, it indicates that one of the higher layers may be at fault:
	- if people are consistently cutting corners, adding tests after the fact, accessing production data...it points to either ignorance or even encouragement by the organisation to behave in this way
