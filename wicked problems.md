- Wicked problems defy solutions, because they're simply too complex.
- In [[Cynefin]] terms, they're complex: they can only be managed through agile, iterative processes
- Indeed, sometimes the solution becomes part of the problem, or has implications in another part of the system that you didn't expect
- this is called Life
- there is a subset of wicked problems that are called 'super wicked problems', such as climate change. They have the following characteristics:
	- time is running out
	- there is either no, or a weak, central authority to address the problem
	- those who caused the problem are also seeking a solution
	- "hyperbolic discounting occurs that pushes responses irrationally into the future"
