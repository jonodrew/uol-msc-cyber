## notes
- paper references Kahneman ([[Thinking Fast and Slow]])
- People do not generally behave rationally
- they rely on their context for clues on what to do next
- rehash of system 1 and system 2 thinking
- in short, any kind of behaviour change requiring cognitive understanding of the change is hard, and deep
	- think about things like *[The Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_(film))* and Basil's work - it's deep, reflective change, but not something you can achieve with a poster
- significantly easier to try to influence the automatic, system 1 thinking
### MINDSPACE
- Messenger
- Incentives, particularly around avoiding loss
- Norms, especially social norms
- Defaults help people go with the flow
- Salience: novelty and relevance attract attention
- Priming: sub-conscious framing can influence decisions
- Affect, or maybe Associations, which can influence our decisions by short-cutting rationality in favour of emotion
- Commitments help people stick to what they say and reciprocate actions
- Ego. We want to act in ways that make us feel better about themselves
