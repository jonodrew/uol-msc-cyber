>Risk reduction â€“ Action taken to lessen the probability, negative consequences, or both, associated with risk
>\- [[ISO 22300]]:2018

With this approach, we try to reduce the [[risk]]. Since risk is a function of [[threat]] and [[vulnerability]], we can try to reduce both. However, when we talk about reduce as an approach, we may also be talking about trying to reduce [[impact]]. For example, if we can't prevent our [[CI/CD]] tooling from touching our database, we can at least reduce the powers that it has so that it can't alter the data in any way. This is also known as reducing the [[blast radius]]
