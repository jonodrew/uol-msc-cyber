Another standard from [[International Standards Organisation|ISO]] in the 27000 series. This one is entitled "Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection â€” Guidance on managing information security risks"

>[!abstract] 
>This document provides guidance to assist organizations to:
>- fulfil the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 concerning actions to address information security risks;
>  - perform information security risk management activities, specifically information security risk assessment and treatment.
>    
This document is applicable to all organizations, regardless of type, size or sector.

It adopts the risk management model established in [[ISO 31000|ISO/IEC ISO 31000]], and provides additional guidance on the three main phases in that standard. 

## Clauses
### 5: Information security risk management
Much of this builds on [[ISO 31000]]. I'm not sure if there's anything specifically tailored here to information assets, as opposed to other kinds of [[asset]].

### 6: Context establishment
An interesting line here, that states 'organisation' can mean specifically a department within an organisation. That is, 'organisation' is fractal: organisations may contain organisations. [It's turtles all the way down.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down).  At the same time, this clause demands that organisations understand their risk appetite.

The risk appetite of the IT department cannot possibly be distinct from the wider organisation - can it? It exists to serve the business. If IT owns the servers, it can have a risk appetite for them - but the information [[asset|assets]] on those servers might belong to someone with a different risk appetite.

### 7. [[Information security]] [[risk assessment]] process
A restating here of the identify-analyse-evalaute risk assessment cycle.

## Annex A
### 1: Information security risk criteria
A really interesting deep dive into risk assessment here. One note stood out to me:

>[!quote] When designing a risk matrix \[...\] an organisation's risk profile is normally asymmetrical. \[...] Although a risk matrix that is symmetrical about its low/low to high/high diagonal can seem easy create and naively acceptable, it is unlikely to represent accurately any organistion's real risk profile, and can therefore yield invalid results

If the scales used are quantitative, and the values represent indices in the same base ($a^x,  a^y$), then the function $f(x, y) : x + y$ can be used to calculate risk levels. However, if too large a base is used, analysts may find there are too many risks in the same level. If the base is not the same ($a^x, b^y$) then summing should not be used.
