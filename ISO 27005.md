Another standard from [[International Standards Organisation|ISO]] in the 27000 series. This one is entitled "Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection â€” Guidance on managing information security risks"

>[!abstract] 
>This document provides guidance to assist organizations to:
>- fulfil the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 concerning actions to address information security risks;
>  - perform information security risk management activities, specifically information security risk assessment and treatment.
>    
This document is applicable to all organizations, regardless of type, size or sector.

It adopts the risk management model established in [[ISO 31000|ISO/IEC ISO 31000]], and provides additional guidance on the three main phases in that standard. 

## Clauses
### 5: Information security risk management
Much of this builds on [[ISO 31000]]. I'm not sure if there's anything specifically tailored here to information assets, as opposed to other kinds of [[asset]].

### 6: Context establishment
An interesting line here, that states 'organisation' can mean specifically a department within an organisation. That is, 'organisation' is fractal: organisations may contain organisations. [It's turtles all the way down.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down).  At the same time, this clause demands that organisations understand their risk appetite.

The risk appetite of the IT department cannot possibly be distinct from the wider organisation - can it? It exists to serve the business. If IT owns the servers, it can have a risk appetite for them - but the information [[asset|assets]] on those servers might belong to someone with a different risk appetite.

### 7. [[Information security]] [[risk assessment]] process
A restating here of the identify-analyse-evalaute risk assessment cycle.
