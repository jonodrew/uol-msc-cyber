This is basically a long list of all of the terrifying flaws in maritime IT systems.

A *long* list

## Abstract
Cyberattacks have been rapidly increasing over the years, resulting to big financial losses to businesses for recovery, regulatory sanctions, as well as collateral damages, such as reputation and trust. In this respect, the maritime sector, which until now was considered safe due to the lack of Internet connectivity and the isolated nature of ships in the sea, is showing a 900% increase in [[cybersecurity]] breaches on operational technology as it enters the digital era. Although some research is being conducted in this area, maritime cybersecurity has not been deeply investigated. Hence, this paper provides a close investigation of the landscape of cybersecurity in the maritime sector with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. First, it explores the systems available on ships that could be targeted by [[attacker|attackers]], their possible vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit, the consequences if the system is accessed, and actual incidents. Then, it describes and analyses possible mitigation actions that can be utilised in advance to prevent such attacks. Finally, several challenges and open problems are discussed for future research.

## Notes
- maritime industry is using more and more computer and [[Internet]]-connected hardware
- there is a system called an 'Automatic Identification System', or AIS
	- it is a radio broadcasting systems that operates on the ship and on shore, and identifies the location of the ship
	- it uses neither [[authentication]] nor [[integrity]] checks ðŸ˜±
