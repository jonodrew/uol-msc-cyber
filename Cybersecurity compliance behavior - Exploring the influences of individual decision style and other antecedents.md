## notes
- new kind of cybersecurity compliance model!
- this one focuses on intrinsic factors, such as 'decision styles'
	- who now
- I will never get tired of authors citing themselves as if they're someone else
	- Do you know "Donalds and Osei-Bryan"?

- Driver (1979) defines decision making style (DMS) as a habitual pattern individuals use in decision making
- propose a two-dimensional model, consisting of tolerance for ambiguity/need for structure and idea (action) orientation/value orientation
- a key claimed factor is "cognitive complexity", which speaks to the axis of high/low tolerance for ambiguity
- early warning siren happening in my head as we try to establish binaries
- four types are established
	- analytical
	- directive
	- behavioral
	- conceptuals
- DSI (Decision Style Inventory) has a test-retest validity of 0.7, apparently
- and this can influence individual compliance behaviours
