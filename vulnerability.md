### Definition
>A weakness of an asset or control that can be exploited by one or more threats

A vulnerability is some facet of a system that is vulnerable to attack. I think it's poor construction to call it a weakness, though semantics is the masturbation of academia so maybe it's best to leave it be. Nonetheless, sometimes a "weakness" is necessary: a system that nobody can use has no weaknesses, aside from the fact that it's useless.

Typical vulnerabilities include:
- system-privileged accounts where the default password has not been changed (privilege escalation and/or repudiation, see [[STRIDE]])
- programs with known flaws (who is installing programs with known flaws?! Tell me. I just wanna talk)
- weak [[firewall]] configurations

## Criticality
The criticality of a vulnerability depends on the potential [[impact]] of an [[attacker]] exploiting it.

We can score vulnerabilities using the [[Common Vulnerability Scoring System|CVSS]]
