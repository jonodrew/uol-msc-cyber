A vulnerability is some facet of a system that is vulnerable to attack. I think it's poor construction to call it a weakness, though semantics is the masturbation of academia so maybe it's best to leave it be. Nonetheless, sometimes a "weakness" is necessary: a system that nobody can use has no weaknesses, aside from the fact that it's useless.
