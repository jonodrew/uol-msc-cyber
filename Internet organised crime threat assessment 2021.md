## Key findings
- [[ransomware]] organisations are now moving down the supply chain to find vectors into target organisations
- they're also starting to use multi-layered extortion: from holding the files ransom to threatening to publish them
- mobile [[malware]] has become scalable
- [[DDoS]] extortion is making a comeback
- Victim-generated [[CSA]] material is increasing, with victims becoming younger
- CSA material distribution across peer-to-peer networks has increased
- online gaming platforms and social media are increasingly being used as vectors for grooming
- investment fraud increased over covid-19, as people became more desperate and started to seek quick ways to relieve the financial burden
- [[dark web|darkweb]] users are increasingly adopting more anonymous [[cryptocurrency]], such as [[Monero]]
- some markets have started enforcing manual [[PGP]], rather than automated, making decryption of messages more difficult even if the market is taken over by law enforcement
