a personality test covering the so-called Big Five personality traits:
- openness
- conscientiousness
- extraversion
- agreeableness
- neuroticism

## Openness
- this facet considers the subject's openness to new experiences
- it is related to imagination, openness to trying (even when there is a likelihood of failure)
- there are two main sub-traits:
	- intellect: an appreciation for abstract ideas, complex problems (and complex problem-solving), and learning. There is no link to the problematic concept of 'IQ'
	- openness: creativity, ingenuity, and enjoyment of beauty (in any form)

## Conscientiousness
- a general description as to whether a subject is organised and hardworking
- it is also related to efficiency and rationality
- there are two main sub-traits here:
	- industriousness: does the subject carry out their plans, remaining focussed, and finishing what they start? We might consider their purposefulness, deliberation, self-discipline, competence, and their desire to achieve
	- orderliness: a general preference for order. Subject may prefer schedules and routines to 'winging it', and will strive to remain tidy

## Extraversion
- sensation-seeking
- extraversion has the following traits:
	- enthusiasm: a tendency towards positive emotions, socialising, and making friends easily
	- assertiveness: somewhere between dominance and agency. It is a quality of leadership, where the subject has a confident composure and is an active participant in their life
## Agreeableness
- broadly, this domain is concerned with being kind, non-critical, altruistic, and trusting
- there are also elements of tenderness, naturalness \[is this a word? _Ed._], tender-mindedness, modesty, and cooperation
- the facets the comprise agreeableness:
	- compassion: interest in others feelings and problems, sometimes called empathy and sympathy
	- politeness: the level of conformance to authority, and unwillingness to seek conflict
## Neuroticism
- sometimes, to keep with the more positive tone of the rest of the model, this domain is inverted and called 'emotional stability'
- we see here moodiness, anxiety, shyness, in some cases low self-esteem, and sometimes depression
- the facets we consider here are:
	- withdrawal: feelings of being threatened, being worried, or generally doubting the world or the self, and vulnerability
	- volatility: the general stability of one's mood, with a particular view to how quickly a subject moves towards 'anger' emotions: irritation, frustration, annoyance, etc
