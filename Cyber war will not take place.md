## Chapter 1: What is cyber war?
- reference Carl von Clausewitz, he of 'war is a mere continuation of politics by other means'
- in his view, war is three things:
	- an act of force or violence
	- it is instrumental: war is not the end goal but the means by which the end is reached
	- it is political: that is, the end mentioned above has a political slant
- therefore if the actor has not committed violence; does not mean to effect change; and that change is not political - it is not war

## Chapter 3: Cyber weapons
- a weapon is an instrument of harm
- thus, a cyber weapon is:
>[!quote] computer code that is used, or designed to be used, with the aim of threatening or causing physical, functional, or mental harm to structures, systems, or living beings
>
>\-p. 37
- Rid then argues against [[Denial of Service|DoS]] and [[DDoS]] attacks as weapons, because the damage they cause is second-order
	- hmmm
- a generic attack that spreads randomly has little value as an instrument of harm. Remember that Rid argues that instrumentality is key to the concept of war. Thus, for example, setting off a worm that cannot be controlled reduces your instrumentality
	- does this imply that highly-virulent biological agents would not be considered weapons by Rid?
	- after all, once it's released, there's no way to turn it off
