There are two distinct version of the internet protocol: v4 and v6. The most obvious difference is address length: v4 uses 32-bit (4 byte) addresses written in decimal, eg `192.168.1.1`. By contrast, v6 uses 128-bit (16 byte) addresses, expressed as eight [[hexadecimal]] numbers divided by colons. They are also often enclosed in square brackets, eg `[2606:2800:0220:0000:0000:0000:25C8:0046]`

The largest 4-digit hexademical number, `FFFF`, corresponds to $16^{4}-1$, or 65536.
