## notes
- three main components:
	- motivation
	- ability or simplicity
	- effective triggers
- motivation is binary: pleasure/pain, hope/fear, social acceptance/rejection
- ability represents the availability of resources: time, energy (spoons), willingness to act against the norm, and extra effort to pick up a non-routine behaviour
- 'effective triggers' is:
	- sparks: designs to motivate individuals
	- facilitators: individuals (?) to add motivation
	- signals: reminders to carry out behaviours
