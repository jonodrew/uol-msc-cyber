A threat is an event that might cause a harmful consequence. Naturally, in a combative competition, one party's threat is another's opportunity. There are therefore very few universal threats. One model for identifying threats is [[STRIDE]]

Threats may arise from nature or from human action; and they may be accidental or deliberate. Their source might be within or without the organisation.
