>Primary legislation is passed by the entire body of the legislature. It's slow to change (because getting hundreds of folks to agree on anything is a nightmare)
>Secondary legislation is law passed by another agency of the state. Although it is colloquially known as 'regulation' it is still the law (and there is an interesting political and social question about whether such agencies ought to have those powers)

>- 'cyber' is so radically different from everything that exists before that we will need to come up with new laws
>- 'cyber' is just another tool - just a slightly sharper flint - and therefore existing legislation is perfectly suitable to regulate it
