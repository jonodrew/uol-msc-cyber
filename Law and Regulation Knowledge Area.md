>Poor security in the development of digital products is a [[negative externality]], and often the responsibility of the civil courts rather than the criminal courts

### 1.5 A more holistic approach to legal risk analysis
- here's the good stuff
- the practice of law is not just 'the rules', but a risk-based approach to the law
- a function is provided (we love a nerd)

$$R = f(P, D, Q, X)$$
Where $R$ is the 'risk weighted cost of the loss of a legal action', $P$ is the relative ability of the prosecutor to prove the case (adjusted by the defendant's ability to rebut that case), $D$ is the defendant's relative ability to prove an affirmative defence (adjusted by the prosecutor's ability to rebut such a case), $Q$ is the total cost to the defendant if the prosecuting party wins the case, and $X$ might as well just be 'miscellaneous': any additional factors that impact the risk.

## Section 3: Privacy laws in general and electronic interception
(Most notes taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuxjbEl40z8)
- there's a strong international agreement that privacy is a (conditional) human right, and that its scope includes private physical space and electronic communication
- However, agreement is weaker on:
	- where, when, and through what media should you expect privacy, and to what degree?
	- what conditions justify an invasion of that privacy?
	- what process is used to decide how that privacy can be broken, and when?
	- what differences in that standard apply to intrusions by the state versus intrusions by non-state actors?
- State interception might also be called [[lawful access]]
- Remember that legal systems differ from place to place
- The [[US]] right to privacy is, sort of, enshrined. In 1967 the US Supreme Court interpreted their fourth amendment...
>[!quote] ### Fourth Amendment
>
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
- as enshrining the right to privacy, which was the opposite to what it ruled in 1928
- states generally have similar opinions with regards to the privacy of children, particularly from their parents
- privacy laws have traditionally treated metadata as a class of data that has a lower expectation of #privacy, though this is now being challenged
- laws that compel citizens to hand over their passwords are tricky from a legal perspective
- interception by non-state actors is generally frowned upon
