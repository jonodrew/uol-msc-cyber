The link between [[ISO 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]] and [[ISO 27002|ISO/IEC 27002]]. Indeed, one of the requirements of [[ISO 27001]] is that an SoA be produced. 

The statement should, for every control in 27002, indicate whether it's been implemented and justification for the decision.

There is disagreement about whether or not this is useful. On the one hand, it generates a huge amount of documentation. There are 93 controls, after all, and not all of them are applicable - but you've still got to give a reason for not applying them.

However: it is a useful document to check to see which controls are being applied (or not!), and the decision-making process that lead to that decision.
