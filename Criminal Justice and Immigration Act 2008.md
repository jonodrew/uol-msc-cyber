## Section 63
- Introduces the offence of possession of extreme pornographic images
- extreme is defined for the purposes of the Act as "an act which threatened a person's life; rape; assault by penetration; sexual interference with a corpse; serious injury to a person's private parts; and intercourse or oral sex with an animal, regardless of whether it is living or dead"

## Defences
- ยง64 provides a defence for 'classified' films, but does not provide a defence if the image or series of images has been extracted principally for the purposes of sexual arousal
- ยง65 sets out three general defences that are the same as the defences for the possession of indecent images of children under [[Criminal Justice Act 1988#Section 160]]:
	- a legitimate reason for possession, or;
	- that the person had not seen it, did not know, and had no cause to suspect it was an offensive image, or;
	- that the receiver did not request it, and did not keep it for an unreasonable time
- ยง66 has defences for people who produce these images (presumably for their own enjoyment?), as long as the whole thing was make-believe, and everybody involved was consenting
	- cf. the [[Jack Harkness test]]
	- by which I mean: animals, corpses, and children cannot consent. This defence therefore cannot be applied in such cases
