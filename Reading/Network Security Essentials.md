### 1.2 The [[OSI]] security architecture
We review words again. We define a security attack, a security mechanism, and a [[security service]] - which unfortunately is not the same definition as used by the cryptographers. Or is it?
### 1.3 Security attacks
Attacks come in two flavours: active and passive. Passive attacks are those that don't alter the state of the system, such as eavesdropping or interception-and-pass-on, while active attacks alter the system or its operation.
### 1.4 [[security service]]
There's a lot there, and some of it's disputed by other parts of this course ðŸ˜¬
### 1.5 security mechanisms
Nothing interesting here, and potentially an error: encipherment should not be considered to provide data integrity (at least as I understand it)
### 1.8 A model for network security
Already covered, ad nauseam, elsewhere in this module
