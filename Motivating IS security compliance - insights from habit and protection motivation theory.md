## notes
- let's talk about [[Protection Motivation Theory]]
- paper argues that protection motivation may be influenced by past behaviour and habits - that is, habit is a source of information
	- although perhaps imperfect?
- people see saving time (which is a proxy for 'doing the job they are paid to do') as a higher reward than following a security policy
- if you get into the habit of complying with policies, the perceived cost of not following them decreases
- paper created five scenarios, and then tested them out on individuals
