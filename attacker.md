- in [[Secure Multiparty Computation]], three kinds of adversary are described:
	- semi-honest/honest-but-curious/passive, where attackers still follow the #protocol 
	- malicious/active: attackers arbitrarily deviate from the protocol
	- covert: may behave maliciously (above), though it will do so in a way that tries to reduce the likelihood of its discovery. Suited to a model where there is a real-world penalty to malicious behaviour being uncovered
