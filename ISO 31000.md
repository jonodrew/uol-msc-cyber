A standard from the [[International Standards Organisation|ISO]] that details an approach to [[risk management]].

The process is broken down into three phases: establishment, assessment, treatment. Additionally, two ongoing functions support this three-phase structure: monitoring and review; and communication and consultation

## scope, context, and criteria establishment
As you can see, there are three parts to this phase. Firstly: the scope, which comes up again and again in management. Then the context: the environment (with every lens: legal, physical, etc) in which the risks are situated. Finally, the risk criteria, or [[risk appetite]], which are the levels of risk the organisation is willing to tolerate.

## [[risk assessment]]

## [[risk treatment]]

## monitoring and review
A reminder that the entire process must be iterative and alive to change - either in the risk landscape or in the scope of what's being protected.

## communication and consultation
All relevant stakeholders should be able to feed into the risk management process
