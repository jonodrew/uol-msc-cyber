## notes
- analysis of two papers about nudges to get users to pick stronger passwords
-  user-centric approaches are the most effective ways
- giving users feedback on the strength of their password helps them *generate* strong passwords - but the paper doesn't mention whether they're memorable or re-usable
	- ie. my critique of this experiment is that it proves you can encourage users to generate strong passwords to meet a target of "happy face", but that doesn't mean it's a *good* password - a good password has to be memorable
	- and if it's not memorable it's probably pretty secure, but in that case just go the whole hog and get a password manager
- specifically, explaining to users why there has to be complexity (time to crack) is valuable
