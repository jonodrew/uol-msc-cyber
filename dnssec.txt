We’ve implemented DNSSEC on security.gov.uk. DNSSEC is a way for a zone to authoritatively attest that the data about the zone came from the right place. It does this by means of a digital signature. When a zone implements DNSSEC, it generates a public/private keypair. It encrypts a hash of the requested data with the private key, and by means of mind-bending mathematics anyone with the public key can confirm that it came from someone holding the private key. For fun, I’ve signed this paragraph.
