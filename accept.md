Thanks [[International Standards Organisation|ISO]]!
This is categorically not the "do nothing" approach: tolerating a [[risk]] means that you've thought about it, and decided that:
- the [[impact]] is low enough that it's acceptable if it happens,
- the [[risk]] is within the organisation's [[risk appetite]]
- measures that would [[reduce]] the risk are too expensive, compared with the financial fallout of the event happening
- the risk is outside the organisation's direct control - though I don't think this is a good example. Plenty of risks outside the organisation's control will [[impact]] the organisation, and there are actions that can be taken to [[reduce]] those risks
