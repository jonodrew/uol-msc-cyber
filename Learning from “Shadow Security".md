- 118 in-depth interviews!!
- introduces the term "shadow security": that is, people doing security in the best way they know how. It might not be compliant, but it's not necessarily non-compliant
- almost no organisation actually checks whether the policies and mechanisms they're trying to get people to conform to are fit for the actual working environment
- sanctions don't work unless you enforce them
- if you enforced them across all non-compliant actors you would have no organisation at all
	- hurray, security achieved!
- persuasion is often not much better, because attending the persuasive training further takes people away from their work
	- womp-womp
- "the first step to creating \[a solution that works] is to identify current non-compliance instances in organizations \[sic], the factors that contribute to their occurrence and the employee responses that manifest"
- users adopt non-compliant behaviours when:
	- they lack awareness, either of the risks or the policy
	- there is a high compliance cost
	- it's actually impossible to comply
- another [[Grounded Theory]] shoutout
- people want to act in secure ways - 
	- I wonder if this ties to [[Inconsistencies Between Information Security Policy Compliance and Shadow IT Usage]]
## recommendations
- reduce compliance costs ([[Compliance Budget]])
- engage users in security design and the assessment of its effectiveness
- "Many security experts still talk (and think) that usability and security create a tradeoff: that usability is nice, but security is important, so it's ok to ask users to make extra effort. But usability is a *hygiene factor* for security: **solutions that are not usable will not work as intended**, period."
