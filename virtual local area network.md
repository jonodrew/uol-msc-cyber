alias: [VLAN, Virtual LAN]
---
A way of partitioning network traffic sent on a single broadcast medium into separate streams. This gives the appearance of separate [[LAN|LANs]], even though there is only one physical network.

One common use-case for a VLAN is to separate [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] traffic from other traffic.
