## Learning objectives
- explain the need for user [[authentication]]
- explain how authentication is different from identification
- understand the three main classes of user authentication methods: something known, something possessed and something that is a personal characteristic (often a physical characteristic)
- provide examples of user authentication techniques
- understand the notion of identity management

## Reading
- [[Computer security#Chapter 4: identification and authentication]]
- 'A survey of wearable [[biometrics|biometric]] recognition systems'

## Lesson 1: types of [[identification]] and [[authentication]]
- no point in doing [[roles-based access control]] control if we're not checking identity
- [[biometrics]] both static and dynamic
## Lesson 2: something known, something possessed

## Lesson 3: [[biometrics]]

### Critical thinking exercise â€“ Deciding on which user authentication method to use

**Purpose**: Gain experience in critically examining and justifying a user authentication mechanism to implement for a company.

**Task**: Envisage that you are the CISO for a new tech company and you are moving into a new building with your colleagues soon.
