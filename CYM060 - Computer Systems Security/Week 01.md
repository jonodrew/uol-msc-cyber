## Learning objectives
- summarise the role of security mechanisms for modern computer systems, including both hardware and software
- define key terms in Computer System Security
- start thinking critically about computer systems security

## Reading
- [[Computer security#Chapter 1: History of computer security]]
- [[Computer security#Chapter 3: Foundations of computer security]]
- 

## Lesson 1: Introduction to computer system security
- this mfer's just got a robot to voiceover his lecture
	- is this some kind of performance piece?!
- Course book will be [[Computer security]]
- There will be labs to demonstrate security issues, but this is not a penetration testing course
- Now we touch on [[authentication]] - how your identity (in the context of the system) is verified
### Critical thinking exercise: [[data breach]]
**Purpose**: Gain experience in critical thinking in relation to security by investigating and reflecting on past data breaches.

**Task**: Come up with two examples of companies that have fallen victim to a data breach. You can do this by performing an online search for inspiration (in for example, online news or press) or use your personal knowledge and experience. Investigate your two data breach cases by doing the following:

-  Explain the reasons for their security failures.
-  Compare the two examples. Where are they similar and where do they differ?

Â You can use the following questions to help your thinking process:

1. Were these human failures or were they machine failures?
2. What were the consequences (harms, penalties, public responses, effects on reputation, etc.) of these data breaches?
3. What lessons do you think the companies should learn as a result?

#### Case 1: [HMRC data breach, 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_United_Kingdom_child_benefit_data_(2007))
The UK's tax authority, HMRC, lost two password-protected discs in the internal mail. The password protection was simply WinZip version 8, which anyone remotely qualified could crack in minutes.

Furthermore, the data was not sanitised before sharing: significant amounts of personal data, including bank details (!) were included in the data that was to be shared.

The security manual for handling data was not made available to the staff who were tasked with this work

The chairman of [[HMRC]] resigned, and an investigation was carried out into the incident

#### Case 2: [University of Essex data breach, 2022](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-61312383)
A supplier to the university accidentally emailed a spreadsheet of personal data. 

However, the impact seems to have been entirely negligible.
