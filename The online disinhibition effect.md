- disinhibition is a neutral term; freed of peer expectations experienced in physical spaces, people may find themselves:
	- being kinder
	- being generous
	- exploring their sexuality and gender identity
	- being more open
	- being more honest
	- being less honest
	- being less kind
- We categorise the causes of these disinhibitions in the following ways:
	- individual differences
	- attenuated status and authority
	- dissociative imagination
	- dissociative anonymity
	- solipsistic introjection
	- asynchronicity
	- invisibility
