A hypothetical case study, set up by the Open University

## Context
A lecturer discovers that someone on eBay is claiming to have exam questions and answers. He asks a third party to purchase the USB stick from eBay, and then plugs the thing directly into his computer ^[Don't do this at home, kids].

He notes that USB drives have serial numbers, and computers track the drives that have been inserted into them. So he wanders off to find the computer that's had this USB stick inside it. [^2] 

The lecturer lures a suspect away from his desk with a false request, and then accesses the suspect's computer. He adds software to carry out forensic analysis, and then lies to a colleague about what he's doing. ^[I'm starting to suspect this isn't actually about forensics]

The lecturer confirms that the eBay advert was accessed from this machine, and notes that further confirmation will be required to demonstrate that the suspect was the person logged in at the time.

The lecturer searches for the files on the drive, and can't find them - either on the desk or in the Recycle Bin ^[Yes, obviously items 'in the Recycle Bin' are still on the disk. Don't be a pedant]. However, the file is indeed on the list of recently used documents. 

The next step would be to image the disk - even if the file has been 'deleted', in [[Windows]] systems that just means 'marked for re-use'. The entire file can still be recovered.
