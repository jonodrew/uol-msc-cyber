An escalation of errors. Given a transmission and an error (any of [[transmission errors]], [[computational errors]], or [[transmission losses]]), an error is "propagated" when more errors are generated in the [[plaintext]] than in the [[ciphertext]]. To put it another way, an error is not propagated if a n-bits of error in the [[ciphertext]] result in n-bits of error in the plaintext
