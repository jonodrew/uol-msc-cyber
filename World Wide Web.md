Time to get into the weeds

The World Wide Web is often considered synonymous with the [[Internet]] - but of course this isn't true. It's really just a way to grab information from remote servers. Your machine uses [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], which runs on [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], which itself runs on the [[Internet Protocol]]. It uses these protocols to grab documents generally written in [[HyperText Markup Language]].

## History
The Web was invented in 1989 by [[Sir Tim Berners-Lee]] as an application for information management. The key concept is/was a Wiki: a set of editable pages, stored across different servers, that can reference each other. 

The Web relies broadly on three technologies:
- [[uniform resource locator]]
- [[HyperText Markup Language]]
- [[HyperText Transfer Protocol]]
Unfortunately, [[HyperText Markup Language|HTML]] now often comes with...[[JavaScript]].
