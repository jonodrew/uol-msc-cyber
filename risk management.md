[[risk|Risk]] management consists of distinct areas: 
- establishing context
- assessment
	- identification
	- analysis
	- evaluation
- treatment
- communication and consultation
- ongoing monitoring and review
## Process
### Context establishment
- what [[asset|assets]] the organisation has
- the objectives of the organisation
- the wider context in which the organisation operates

### Risk identification
- begin by identifying [[threat|threats]] and getting a clear picture of any known [[vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] 
- once each threat has been identified, each should be considered with the lens of its [[impact]] on the asset we're examining

### Risk analysis
- Having identified the impact from each threat, we assess the likelihood of the threat being realised
>[!warning] 
>It's worth noting and remembering that this should be an iterative process. Likelihoods can go up as well as down. Consult your doctor before starting a new course of medication. Terms and conditions may apply

- the output of this step is a risk matrix, which is usually two-dimensional. This is easier to read on a screen, though I've read that [NASA experimented with three-dimensional matrices](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20100024129/downloads/20100024129.pdf). They might be three by three (high/medium/low) or five by five (1-5 ratings). Regardless of the layout, the most important thing is to ensure it's used commonly through an organisation. cf. [[Wardley map]]
- this matrix lays out 9 or 25 or however many squares, and we can then group those squares into collections of risk ratings. For example, using a 1-5 scale:
	- 0-1: Low risk
	- 4-12 inclusive: medium risk
	- 16-25 inclusive: High risk
- This is obviously simplified - some organisations will say "anything above a 2 on impact, regardless of likelihood, is high risk"
- The assessment for each threat can be added to a [[risk register]]. There should be details of the impact and likelihood of each threat, the risk level, treatment options, the responsible person, and ideally a review date

### Risk treatment
Having created a risk matrix, there are (broadly speaking) four basic choices
1. avoid/terminate risk. This might be by *not* doing something, or immediately stopping doing something
2. mitigate the risk in some way
3. transfer or share some part of risk, for example by insuring against the possibility
4. accept/tolerate the risk

### Communication and consultation
If this is being carried out as an 'internal consulting' job, you'll have to communicate continuously with the asset owner.
