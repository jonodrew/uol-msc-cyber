1. An [[encryption algorithm]] whereby the number of possible [[encryption key]] is equal to the number of possible [[plaintext]]. That is, the key is always as large as the plaintext.
2. The key is selected uniformly at random (truly random!) from all possible keys
3. The [[key]] should not ever be deliberately re-used
They are not particularly practical. However, they have been successfully used, most notably by the [[Portland Spy Ring]].
