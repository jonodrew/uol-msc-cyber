>- nobody can really define resilience - in engineering, it's robustness in the face of a changing environment whereas in ecology it's adaptation in the same context
>- it's possible that it's both, just seen with differing levels of maturity
>>[!quote] At the most mature end of the resilience continuum, a minority of organisations can leveerage the transformative power of resilience to seize the new opportunities created by a changing environment and use adversity as a growth opportunity (Davidson et al., 2016)

>	- situational awareness
>	- governance
>	- pre-event knowledge management
>	- security
>	- visibility
>	- velocity
>	- recovery management 
>	- ability to adapt

>- consultants really like it
>- four tensions:
>	- I don't know what it means
>	- I don't know what it means in context
>	- I don't know how to make other people in the business care

>- how do you make sense of so much noise? AI, like playbooks, is best suited to simple/complicated systems
>- ooh, I like the idea of taking the concepts of how 'affordable' a risk is from banking
>- people will save you in a crisis
>- the best incident response practitioners are curious, creative, and flexible. They're also great communicators
>- Netflix launching a 'reservist' programme to train an auxiliary corps of crisis managers
>- the number of controls in standards means that it's impossible to be compliant, and impossible to know if you are compliant
