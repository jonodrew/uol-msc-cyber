## notes
- extends [[Theory of reasoned action]]
- perceived behavioural control, attitude towards the behaviour, and subjective norms predict intention
- it is intention which leads to the behaviour
- 'perceived behavioural control' is an evaluation of internal and external 'factors' that aid or impede the performance of the behaviour
- 'attitude' is the personal evaluation (according to what metric?) of performing, or not performing, a behaviour
- 'subjective norms' are beliefs about general societal expectations about the behaviour that result in social pressure to perform, or not perform, that behaviour
- in summary, if the user:
	- can do it/can resist doing it
	- has a positive attitude to doing/not doing it
	- sees other people around them doing/not doing it
- they are more likely to comply
