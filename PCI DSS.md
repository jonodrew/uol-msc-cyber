The Data Security #standard for the [[PCI|Payment Card Industry]]

Adherence to this standard is mandatory (according to whom?) for organisations that handle card payments. There are 12 compliance requirements, and these are grouped into six 'control objectives'.

## Objectives
1. Build and maintain a secure network and systems
2. Protect cardholder data
3. maintain a vulnerability management program
4. implement strong access control measures
5. regularly monitor and test networks
6. maintan an information security policy (is this the same as an [[information security management system|ISMS]]?)
