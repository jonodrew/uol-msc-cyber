## notes
- human-centred security design must consider:
	- security,
	- usability,
	- accessibility
- though it's actually just one of the authors, [[Karen Renaud]], who's argued for accessibility
- though [[Wang]] 2017 makes a similar call for inclusivity, and an accessible system is an inclusive system
- we essentially assume able-bodied people when we talk about security
- poverty is disabling
- the paper then dissects the [[National Cyber Security Centre|NCSC]] cyber-hygiene checklist
- they're open about the fact that they categorically don't have answers, just issues
