[[fully homomorphic encryption]] over the [[Torus]]
- an extension of the GSW scheme
- based on a bootstrapped [[NAND]] gate, which reduces noise every time it's used
	- in TFHE it takes only around 0.05s, which compared to a [[plaintext|cleartext]] NAND operation is abysmal but is an order of magnitude better than the minutes it was previously taking
- It also uses bootstrapping keys of around 24Mb
- It uses the _real_ torus
	- as opposed to what ðŸ˜­
- $(\mathbb{T}, +, \cdot)$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-module 
	- Eh?
	- apparently this means that the external product $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{T} \rightarrow \mathbb{T}$ is well defined
	- it is also an _abelian_ group: $x + y \mod 1$ 
	- any integer multiplied by a value in the torus is defined
	- however, it's not a _ring_: two values within the torus have an undefined product
