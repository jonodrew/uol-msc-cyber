## Learning objectives
-   critically discuss elements of the cyber security industry
-   identify cyber security threats and cybercrime in the context of businesses and individuals
-   consider and discuss cyber risk and risk management
-   describe some cyber security controls and services and explain how they can mitigate risks
## A model of the information security industry
The model starts with [[producer]] to [[consumer]] relationships. That is, those producing [[cyber security]] products and services, and those consuming them. These consumers might be other businesses - which we can organise by [[vertical]] - or indeed might be the [[producer]] again. End-users, like you and me, may buy products or services from the [[consumer]]. We don't necessarily need to care where our supermarkets get their cyber security products and services from. Unless they're bad, of course.

In some rare cases, [[producer|producers]] can supply direct to end-users - like in the case of [[anti-virus]] and software. 

Producers are consumers too, though. If you want to build the latest in cyber security products, you'll need an IT function - which opens you up to cyber attack. Even if you decide you'll write software on paper, your HR team will need software to make sure you're paid, and that software will have to be secured. So producers will consume cyber security products - sometimes they'll even [[eat their own dog food]] and use their own!

Sensitive industries may be restricted in terms of the products and services that make up their supply chain. Recently in the UK, the Government decided that [[5G]] infrastructure should not include anything produced by the [[China|Chinese]] company [[Huawei]]. This was as much a political as a technical decision, but nonetheless producers and suppliers must abide by them. Enforcement is generally managed by the [[enforcer]], which could be a regulatory body set up by the government.

The final element of this model is the [[attacker|adversary]]: the reason we do all of this. Without an adversary trying to get in, there's not much point to the whole thing. Luckily, we're not short of adversaries.
## Lecture 4 - Exploring cyber security consumers
## [[consumer|Consumer]] verticals
- [[Critical national infrastructure]], which in the UK is defined by the [[Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure]]
- Banking and securities
- Communications, media and services
- Manufacturing and raw materials
- ...
Note that threat intelligence sharing is encouraged, particulary in the [[Critical national infrastructure]] space. [[National Cyber Security Centre|NCSC]] runs the [[Cyber security information sharing partnership]], which shared intelligence across the UK's sensitive industries.
### #caseStudy: electrical energy
The UK's electricity provision is privatised and regulated by [[Ofgem]]. The [[Wardley map]] for electricity provision is messy, where nodes can be provided by a number of organisations. Starting with the user (as always), there's the most obvious supplier: the people you pay money to so that electricity comes out of your sockets and powers your microwave. Then there's distribution network operators (DNOs), which get electricity from the core network (where the voltage is between 275 kV and 400 kV) to consumers. Heavy industry might use up to 33kV; light industry 11kV; and our homes only 230V. [See this very handy note from Parliament](https://www.parliament.uk/globalassets/documents/post/pn163.pdf). Then there are the companies running the actual generation of the electricity, like the French-state owned ElectricitÃ© de la France (EDF), who run most nuclear power stations in the UK. Their power plants will likely use [[industrial control system|industrial control systems]] and [[supervisory control and data acquisition]] systems to manage their heavy machinery.
>[!warning]
>The experience of [[stuxnet]] is a reminder that the criticality of these systems discourages the kind of continuous update recommended in other sectors. Because any downtime is disastrous, and any attack calamitous, these systems are [[air-gapped]] and often rarely updated
### Lecture 5: [[attacker|adversary]] and [[enforcer]]
There are national and international bodies with an interest in enforcement. [[Interpol]] has strong opinions on [[cyber crime]], for example! Consider also bodies like the [[PCI]], which provides international standards for how to take card payments.
In the UK, our law enforcement bodies look to prevent cyber crime and capture criminals. The [[National Crime Agency]] is the main law enforcement body in this space, although the [[Metroplitan Police Service]] also has some specialists in this area. The previously mentioned [[National Cyber Security Centre|NCSC]] and [[Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure|CPNI]] offer guidance and advice, as well as co-ordinating functions in times of crisis. Additionally, the [[Information Commissionerâ€™s Office|ICO]] is the government's regulator in terms of the [[Data Protection Act]], which is sometimes erroneously referred to as [[GDPR]]. 

An [[attacker|adversary]] is, from a certain angle, a [[producer]]. They have the same boring functions, like HR, and some even sell B2B rather than actually conducting the crime themselves. They might also launder money, fence stolen data, or recruit individuals.

## Week 2
### Lecture 6: [[threat]], [[vulnerability]], [[impact]]
- [[cyber crime]]: it's beyond boundaries and it's easier to scale. 
- How do criminals attack systems? [[attack vector]]s. 
- Where do they attack? The [[attack surface]], which is the exposed part of a system. Decreasing one's attack surface is a good way to reduce [[risk]]. 
- We move on to some definitions:
	- [[asset]], or target.
	- [[threat]] 
	- [[vulnerability]] - a weakness of an asset or [[control]]
	- [[risk]]
	- and [[impact]]
- We now move on to the [[attacker|threat actor]], and look at their characteristics
- OR DO WE!
- We don't. We instead turn to the question of _why_ crime happens. Here's a proposed reason:
>[!quote]
>...the probability that a violation will occur at any specific time and place might be taken as the function of the convergence of likely offenders and suitable targets in the absence of capable guardians
>\-Cohen, L.E and M. Felson

We then get a definition of [[threat intelligence]]:
>[!quote]
>Threat information that has been aggregated, transformed, analysed, intepreted or enriched to provide the necessary context for decision-making processes

### Lecture 7
Let's move on to kinds of [[attacker|threat actor]]

We look at a "weighted arc circumplex model", and there's a reading on it - [[A typology of hackers]]
### Lecture 8: Cyber threats
- First up: [[TTP]]
- Then we have [[ransomware]], [[malware]], [[cryptojacking]], email related threats, threats against data, [[DDoS]], and [[disinformation]]
- There are, of course, accidents. They're nonetheless a [[risk]].
- Sigh. Then we come to the [[cyber kill chain]]
### Lecture 9: types of [[cyber crime]]
- differentiation between cyber-enabled and cyber-dependent crime
- three broad areas of cyber crime:
	- actions against [[CIA triad]]
	- actions for the purposes of personal or financial gain, or for the purposes of harm towards others
	- actions related to computer content (?)
		- obscene (adult) and indencent (underage) content. See also [[CSA]]
		- [[extreme pornography]]
		- [[revenge pornography]]
		- selling stolen personal data (eWhoring) (??)
		- hate speech
		- [[misinformation]]
	- interpersonal crime
		- [[cyberbullying]]
		- [[cyber stalking]]
		- [[grooming]]
		- [[CSA]] material
		- live streaming of [[CSA]]
		- [[identity theft]]/[[identify fraud]]
	- serious crime
		- [[organised crime]]
### Question: cyber threats in your local context
My answer:
The most important cyber threat at this point in time is, in my opinion, ransomware. It is the lowest common denominator, spray-and-pray, zero-effort way for criminals to make money.
Until this point, a vulnerability that allowed an attacker access to the internals of your system was only a problem if the attacker was trying to gain a foothold. It was the first step towards espionage or potentially data exfiltration for sale, but generally speaking an attacker had to be motivated to attack _your company_
Ransomeware throws that in the bin. The aim is not to target a specific organisation: it is to target any organisation that has a vulnerability. Ransomware is the cyber crime equivalent of a novel virus or the invention of lying: almost everyone is vulnerable because nobody considered this possibility before. 
Following this logical chain, it is even more high impact because it is untargeted. Recent attacks have hit high-profile organisation like hospitals, and in some cases the attacker felt deep remorse about this accidental collateral damage. The impacts of ransomware on hospitals and government departments result in measurable increases in deaths.
Defending against attacks like these is generally a case of getting basic cyber hygiene better. In general, the model is the same as being chased by a bear. You do not need to be the fastest runner, but you must not be the _slowest_. More broadly, using systems like DKIM can reduce risks from phishing attacks; locking down ports that are exposed to the Internet can reduce attack surface; and frequent, off-site backups can reduce the impact of the inevitable attack.
### Lecture 10: The big issues
- the [[dark web]]: issues of [[anonymity]], [[privacy]], security, with a perspective on [[encryption]]
- [[surveillance]]
- [[organised crime]]: evolving business models, relationship to [[nation-state]], and other opportunities
	- as technologies evolve, so does the opportunistic nature of attacks
	- in [[China]], as an example, many hacker collectives either have the [[nation-state]] as a client or a sponsor. By contrast, [[Russia]] employs criminals directly
	- acting against [[cyber crime]] is a challenge to most nations: it is the problem of cross-border collaboration writ large. One attempt at simplifying this is the [[Budapest Convention on cyber crime]]
	- the [[United Nations]] has a working group and committee called (please let this not be a quiz question) "The Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes"
	- the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] formed a multilateral cyber action committee, which is a group of former senior government and business leaders from the [[US]], [[Europe]], and [[Japan]]
- [[cyber warfare]]
- collaboration and trust
- the problem of [[attribution]]
