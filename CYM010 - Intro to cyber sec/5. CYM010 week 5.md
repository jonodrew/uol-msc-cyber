Following on from [[4. CYM010 week 4]], we're going to start looking at computer security
## Lesson 1: An introduction to computer security principles
- New book: [[Computer Security principles and practice]]. We'll be reading overview in chapter 1, pages 23-51
## Review questions:
- Difference between network attack surface and software attack surface?
	- Network: attack surface exposed by the network, whether that's internal, the Internet, etc

## Lesson 2: Recovering from a security incident
- repair residual risks
- review what happened
- recover data
- List the three major hard drive storage problems solved by file systems
	- Finding shit
	- Storing shit
	- Managing space
## Lesson 3: Authenticating people
### Passive token
Same token every time. Could be done through hasing a password the same way every time

### Active token
Always different

## Five generic attacks on authentication systems
- Cloning
- Sniffing/replay
- Steal from backups
- Trial and error/brute force
- [[Denial of Service]] - change the FRR/FAR to make the system unusable
