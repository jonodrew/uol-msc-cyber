	- approximate greatest common divisor (approximate-GCD)
- NTRU, which is an open-source implementation. The acronym (pronounced en-true) was originally derived from (deep sigh) the pun _Number Theorists 'R' Us_ [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTRU)
- (Ring-) Learning With Errors problems (LWE)

## (Ring-)LWE-based schemes
### BGV-like
- smaller [[ciphertext]]s
- B(G)V: named after its creators, [[Gentry]], [[Zvika Brakerski]], and [[Vinod Vaikuntanathan]]
- B/FV: named after *its* creators, the B of which is [[Zvika Brakerski]] again
- HEEAN
### GSW- like
- larger [[ciphertext]]s
- noise grows slower than in BGV-like schemes
- GSW itself
- FHEW
- [[TFHE]]
