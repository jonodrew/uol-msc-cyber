## notes
- if you want to encourage a behaviour, make it easy, make it attractive, make it social, make it timely

### Easy
- defaults are what we default to
- no hassle, no fuss
- simplify messages into steps
### Attractive
- draw users' attention
- design rewards and sanctions for maximum effect
	- they argue that lotteries are very effective and quite cheap
### Social
- make it social, or stress how unsociable it is
- make people want to talk to their networks about it
- encourage commitments to each other
### Timely
- act when habits are already disrupted
- act when people are most likely to take an action
- consider the immediate costs and benefits
- offer people a plan towards the action
## Projects
(this feels very similar to [[Can we sell security like soap? a new approach to behaviour change]])
### Define the outcome
- identify the behaviour
- define how it can be measured
- find the metric. It's better if it's already collected, because now you've got a baseline
- how long do you wait before you write off the experiment as a failure?
- define your cost/benefit (ah, I love the smell of the Green Book in the morning)
### Understand the context
- Go to where the problem is
	- No, closer
	- No, the actual problem
	- No, you can't send someone else
- Develop insights
- Design a solution that is feasible and sensitive to the context
- Consider the burden on the provider and on the user
### Build the intervention
- use [[#^9955c7|EAST]] to develop an insight
- return to steps one and two to iterate your insights. Your first idea was probably wrong
### Test, learn, adapt
- use randomised controlled trials if you can
- but if not, at the very least measure the effects (not the awareness!)
