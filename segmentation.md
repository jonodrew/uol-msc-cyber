A way of structuring memory. Data is divided into logical blocks, each with  a unique name. Items within the segment are addressed by {segment name}{offset}. The [[operating system]] maintains a table of segment names with their true memory addresses in memory.

Because memory is divided into logical units, it is simple to apply security policies across them. However, segments have variable length, making memory management more difficult - we like fixed-length blocks for efficient tessalation.
