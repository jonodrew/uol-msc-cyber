A standard published by the [[International Standards Organisation|ISO]]. This is the standard that deals with information security management. The full title of the document is "[[information security management system]] requirements". It specifies a sequence of steps an organisation must take in order to set up their [[information security management system|ISMS]]. It is fairly high level, and should be read with [[ISO 27002]], which functions as a catalogue of security controls that can be implemented as part of the [[information security management system|ISMS]].

It is possible to be certified against this standard.
