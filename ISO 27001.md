A standard published by the [[International Standards Organisation|ISO]]. This is the standard that deals with information security management. The full title of the document is "[[information security management system]] requirements". It specifies a sequence of steps an organisation must take in order to set up their [[information security management system|ISMS]]. It is fairly high level, and should be read with [[ISO 27002]], which functions as a catalogue of security controls that can be implemented as part of the [[information security management system|ISMS]].

It is possible to be certified against this standard.
## The standard

### Context of the organisation
The organisation must identify all the interested parties (in the organisation? in the system, eg shareholders?) and their needs for cybersecurity. The scope of the [[information security management system|ISMS]] must be decided - that is, we must make a decision about what assets we want to protect

### Leadership
One requirement for leadership is, obviously, to show leadership. That is, there must be top level support for cybersecurity, and that must be communicated clearly through the organisation. Additionally, a top level security policy must be established, documented, and again disseminated to the organisation. Finally, roles and responsibilities for the [[information security management system|ISMS]], and reporting its performance, must be set up

### Planning
An appropriate risk assessment process should be set up. Criteria should be decided for risk appetite, and consequently risk acceptance. Additionally a process should be agreed for risk treatment to cover selection of treatment options, selection of controls, and gaining acceptance of residual risks.

### Support
Sufficient support (in material terms) must be provided to the ISMS. That is, the staff must be qualified, and that every employee has a good idea of the awareness of security policies and the ISMS

### Operation
The organisation, implementation and control of the process. 

### Performance evaluation
Firstly, that the organisation itself is reviewing the effectiveness of its ISMS. Secondly, that there are periodic audits (remember that retrosespectives and reviews are not equivalent to audits!) of the ISMS.

### Improvement
The organisation must have the capacity to react to security breaches, including fixing the immediate breach, conducting root cause analysis, and modifying the ISMS to prevent recurrence if possible.
