## Chapter 1
- there is no single explanation for criminality
	- but there are a lot of theories, and they're not necessarily in competition
### Societal, community, socialisation influence, and individual theories
- the most macro-level theories are societal
- then community, though the author notes that this may be less applicable on the [[Internet]]
- then socialisation theories
- and then finally the most atomic: individual

### Applying theories of crime to cybercrime
- social construction, or:  there's no such thing as an objective crime
	- post-modernism babee!
	- but a valid and interesting point nonetheless
	- do the norms exist for 'new crimes' to be defined, if crimes are solely defined by society?
- biological theories:
	- we all know phrenology is absolute nonsense, right?
	- [oh god](https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2023/08/15/angel-skull-vs-witch-skull-is-tiktoks-latest-wild-beauty-standard/)
	- [Please stop yassifying phrenology](https://twitter.com/stofthemidwest/status/1691889777019125969)
	- still, some people make biological arguments for crime, like:
		- men commit more crimes than women!
		- evolution! (??)
		- genetics!
	- we won't spend much time talking about those theories. because I think they're silly
- learning theories
	- drawing on the work of [[B.F Skinner]], he of the kamikaze pigeons
	- ie operant conditioning - we'll do things that we receive rewards for and avoid behaviours we're punished for
	- we might also learn from our peers and social group
### Eysenck's theory of crime
- a theory of crime combining genetics, personality traits, and environmental factors, as well as their interactions with each other
- in particular neuroticism, extraversion, and psychoticism are called out as indicators of criminality
- the theory is not supported by research findings
	- what. is the point. of writing this
