A cell is a collection of eight [[flip-flop]] circuits. Since eight [[bit|bits]] is a [[byte]], a cell has a memory capacity of one byte. We suppose that all of the cells are in a single long row (they needn't be physically arranged like this), and this gives us the concept of a linked list and consequently a way of thinking about the next/last cell. With that comes the ability to store data that is larger than a byte, by breaking it up across different cells.
