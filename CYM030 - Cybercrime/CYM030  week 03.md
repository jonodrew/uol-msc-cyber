This week we look at interpersonal crime, sometimes known as content crime. These are crimes that make use of the internet and mobile devices to harass individuals and include social media offences and various offences connected to pornography. Unfortunately, the possessing, making and sharing of [[CSA|child sexual abuse]] material, sometimes referred to as child porn, is very wide spread on the internet despite the strict laws prohibiting it. This week includes reference to/consideration of themes, which might trigger unwelcome and distressing memories or thoughts for some students. Students might wish to discuss any particular concerns with their tutor. No images of any sort will be shown. Care should be taken when searching around the topics mentioned.

## Lesson 1: Social media offences
### Interpersonal crimes
- often crimes that existed before, but have been amplified by the power of the [[Internet]]
- they are therefore cyber-enabled, not cyber-dependent
- there are definitions available from the CPS for the terms 'grossly offensive' and 'indecent',  as well as 'offensive', and 'obscene'
- note the difference in the UK between the Crown court and the magistrates court:
	- magistrates are trained volunteers
	- Crown courts are presided over by judges and verdicts given by juries

## Lesson 2: cyber stalking and cyber bullying
- cyber-stalking is a form of harassment, see [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]]
	- the [[Internet]] has made it possible for any creep, anywhere, to stalk someone
	- [[doxxing]] is included in these offences
	- cyber-stalking specifically is not defined separately to stalking/harassment
- cyber-flashing (eh??) is dealt with under [[Sexual Offences Act 2003#Section 66|§66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. However, this does not cover the offence of sending obscene images to a person. The [[Online Safety Bill]] has provisions to deal with this. Note that the bill has been criticised by many, but is also supported by organisations such as the [[NSPCC]] 
- The [[Voyeurism Act 2019]] amended §67A of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] to make 'upskirting' a crime
- Many of these crimes are directed against women and female-presenting people, and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] recognises this
- cyber-bullying could fall under:
	- [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]]
	- [[Malicious Communications Act 1988]] or [[Communications Act 2003]], depending on the nature of the messages being sent

## Lesson 3: Pornography offences
- some kinds of pornography are legal
- "it is very widespread on the [[Internet]]" says the lecturer, with a completely straight face
![[Pasted image 20230801085934.png]]
- victim blaming can get in the bin, and this extends even to the way we discuss remedies to the offence
- the law does not define pornography, but it does define obscene
- "after all, why film a murder?"
## Lesson 4: [[CSA|child sexual abuse]] material
- this is dealt with by the law in part by the [[Protection of Children Act 1978]]
- the [[United Nations]] has tried to stem this, but without much success
- note that the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003#Section 45]] raises the age of adulthood for the purposes of indecent images
- a less-used act in this area is the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009#Section 62]]
- images are categorised, with Category A being the worst
- there are three general defences: lack of awareness; legitimate reason; and marriage or other relationships
