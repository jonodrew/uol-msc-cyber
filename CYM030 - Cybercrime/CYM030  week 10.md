In this final week we revisit and examine in more detail some challenges and dilemmas revolving around [[cybercrime]]. We explore specific real-world cybercrime case studies, drawing links with all previous weeks. Finally, we discuss evidence on how cybercrime might be shaped in the near future.

### Learning Objectives

---

- Elaborate on the current and future trends in cybercrime
- Reflect on the challenges related to cybercrime, including technological, ethical and societal angles
- Analyse cybercrime cases based on technological, individual and cultural dimensions
## Reading
- [[Common challenges in combating cybercrime]]
- [[Cyber attack attribution]]
## Lesson 1: Challenges
- there is a lack of theories of the criminology of cybercrime
- 'freedom of speech' is a tricky thing to define at the best of times, and even more so in the space of the [[Internet]]
>[!question] To what extent do you agree with the following?
>
>>[!quote] Governments and law enforcement agencies should be allowed to bypass end-to-end encryption in order to identify illegal materials
>
>>[!quote] Privacy and the use of encryption are fundamental rights in the digital age, and they should be preserved

## #caseStudy  San Bernadino shooting
>[!question]
>1. Investigate the San Bernandino shooting in the USA and the subsequent legal confrontation between the FBI and Apple.
>2. Briefly describe the case, the court order and the companyâ€™s response. How did the FBI resolve the issue?
>3. Reflect on and describe the underlying challenge brought to light with this case and provide your views on whether the involved parties acted appropriately. Support your views with arguments and examples and record them in your study journal.
- the full story of this is horrific, but the part we are most concerned about is the [attempt to decrypt the phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack#Phone_decryption)
- the underlying challenge is whether a private corporation is required to provide a backdoor into its technology for a government
- The [[FBI]] resolved this by using an external company to hack into the system
- There is no single underlying challenge. This question is a mess of pragmatism against idealism; of short-term versus long-term thinking.
## Lesson 2: case studies
### [[United Kingdom|UK]] #caseStudy : manga
- Robul Hoque was arrested and charged with possession of indecent images of children. The images are 'manga Japanese-style' - that is, cartoons
- the images were so realistic that he was convicted for making indecent 'pseudo-photographs' of children
- 'pseudo-photograph' is a term that was coined in the [[Protection of Children Act 1978]]
- no actual minors were abused or harmed in the creation of this content
- a short detour into the [[COPINE scale]] and the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]]
- A reminder that the law is not based on science or scientific research. It is the current societal view on what is acceptable
	- excepting the cases where it has not been updated to reflect modern consensus on what is ethical
