## Lesson 1: Introduction
1. What do we mean by the terms 'crime' and [[cyber crime]]?
2. How does [[cyber crime|cybercrime]] relate to traditional crime?
3. What conditions shape [[cyber crime|cybercrime]]?
4. Why does (cyber)crime happen in the first place?
5. How can we study the various aspects of [[cyber crime|cybercrime]]
6. Who are the cyber criminals, and what motivates them?
7. What is a cybercrime? How is it defined in legislation?
8. Who are the victims of [[cyber crime|cybercrime]]? What are the impacts?
9. What is the opportunistic nature of [[cyber crime|cybercrime]]? (Feels like the answer is in the question there)
10. What are the tools and methods used by cybercriminals?
11. What are the challenges of cybercrime for criminal justice and law enforcement?
12. How can we minimise cybercrime?
13. Into which arenas does cybercrime expand?
14. How does cybercrime affect economic, societal, and behavioural aspects of [[Internet]] usage?
15. Can we ever confidently attribute cyber attacks?
16. What is the future of cybercrime?

## Lesson 2: what is [[cyber crime|cybercrime]]?
- is it distinct from crime? 
- does it rely on computers?
- the [[EU|European Union]] defines it as:
>[!quote] a broad range of different criminal activities where computers and information systems are involved either as a primary tool or as a primary target
>
>\- European Union, 2013

- this was from a year when the punctuation harvest was particularly poor
>[!quote] Working definition
>Cybercrime constitutes acts punishable by law, which utilise information and communication technology (ICT) either to target data, systems, networks, technology or humans, or to facilitate the commission of further offences

- cyber-dependent versus cyber-enabled cybercrime

## Lesson 2: The importance of [[cyber crime|cybercrime]]
- Cybercrime-as-a-Service
- Ransomware-as-a-Service
- Ah, the debate about end-to-end [[encryption]]
- is [[ransomware]] cyber-dependent or cyber-enabled?
	- yes

## Lesson 3: Cybercrime [[threat]]s and [[attacker|threat actor]]s
- reading from [[Internet organised crime threat assessment 2021]]

## Lesson 4: Cybercrime surveys
- firstly: we don't know how much crime is happening
	- and that means we don't know how much cybercrime is happening
- we can try measuring through law enforcement reports; however, there are concerns about the validity of these reports
- there's also no universal standard for crime reporting
- *and* much crime is not reported
- surveys are also very difficult! Getting a statistically meaningful response and a useful sample is quite difficult
- some phenomena, however, are not evenly distributed across a national population
	- 'have you experienced a mugging in the last year' is a question whose answer would vary across different populations, and so while *nationally* we might get one answer, we'd get a different answer if we selected for more vulnerable groups
- some phenomena, such as the weight of newborns, follow a normal distribution - that is, they form a bell curve
- other phenomena follow a power-law:
	- the distribution of wealth in certain populations
	- the frequency of use of words in a language
	- the size of earthquakes
	- the frequency of use of first names in a specific cultural context
	- citations of academic papers
- additionally, we should consider self-selection bias when we run surveys
	- they are often not representative
