The lessons this week cover transport crime. This crime can directly impact the supply chains that allow for the efficient and timely movement of goods around the world. Such attacks can be carried out using [[ransomware]] on websites or they can be directed at the assets used in the aviation, road and rail, and maritime sectors themselves.

### Learning Objectives

---

- Analyse threats to the supply chain of the aviation, maritime and transport sectors
- Analyse the threats that are unique to the the aviation, maritime and transport sectors face
- Identify trends in cyber crime across the aviation, maritime and transport sectors
## Reading
- [[HFACS]]
- [[Aviation Cyber Security Strategy]]
- [[Cybersecurity challenges in the maritime sector]]

## Lesson 1: Transport crimes/supply chains
- extortion?
- what about *double extortion*: exfiltration of data and a threat of sharing the data, thereby putting the organisation in breach of GDPR. The organisation then has to balance paying the ransom with the fine that will be levied by the EU
- what about *triple extortion!!*: where the exfiltrated data can be used to identify further targets. For example, revealing medical records, use of services, etc
## Lesson 2: Aviation [[cyber crime|cybercrime]]
- there are so many things that can go wrong
- Like [a flight plan being logged incorrectly](https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/NERL%20Major%20Incident%20Investigation%20Preliminary%20Report.pdf)

## Lesson 3: Rail and Road
- we only have to consider the difference between mainline and metro rail
- there are so many things that can go wrong here, too
- computers were a mistake

## Lesson 4: maritime crime
- military ships
- passenger ships
- cargo ships
- we're not going to worry about pleasure ships
	- Martin what is a pleasure ship
