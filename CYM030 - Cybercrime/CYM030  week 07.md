In this week we take a tour to explore criminal profiling. In order to do so, we examine identity, trust, personality, and culture, as key components. We examine a theoretical model for cybercriminal profiling and we discuss the complex relationships between personality traits, cultural influences, and individual identity in shaping criminal behaviour.

### Learning Objectives
---
- Explore the psychological theories and frameworks that explain criminal behavior, including psychopathy, antisocial personality disorder, and other relevant psychological constructs
- Analyse how personality traits, cultural influences, and individual identity interact and contribute to criminal tendencies
- Analyse case studies and research findings to understand the underlying psychological factors that drive criminal actions and decision-making processes
- Explore the human, psychological and behavioural aspects of [[attacker|attackers]] and targeted individuals

## Lesson 1: Identity and trust in [[cyber crime|cybercrime]]

- these days, individuals committing cybercrimes entirely by themselves are rare
- instead, there is a broader ecosystem within which criminals work, dividing their labour for more effective criming
- the nickname/handle is the entire brand
- however, using only one username is a single point of failure
- additionally, multiple identities allow for vertical integration and legal separation - you can get someone on the sale of malware but may not necessarily be able to link their natural identity to the 'making' identity
	- I call this the 'Sheinhardt Wig Company' approach ![[Pasted image 20230826121203.png]]
- Organised crime structures emerge as a response to a lack of trust and the overall uncertainty \[...] around the identity of the seller \[...] and around the quality of the products or services offered \[Yip et al., 2013]
	- is this true of other organisations, I wonder?
- Organisation breeds competition
- Competition results in a marketplace
- And the advertising approaches are pretty much the same as they are for legal products - free samples, money-back guarantees, extensive documentation...even offering free product to influencers!
	- *crimfluencers*
- there is also a class of criminal that preys on criminals, called rippers
	- nature red in tooth and claw, babeee
- actors have strategies in place to try to identify accounts that have been appropriated by law enforcement
- one approach is to ask the individual to commit an illegal act; however, many jurisdictions make provision for law enforcement agents to do exactly that
- collaboration is considered in the longer-term, and not merely in the short-term maximisation
	- cf. Game theory in repeated games
	- [Here's a cute Youtube explainer](https://youtu.be/emyi4z-O0ls?si=-eQzJoTg8hwg9y-L)
- referrals are also very important
	- criminals be reinventing society
- the seller of GOVRAT, who is also its maker, used aliases such as '[[Daniel Kaye|spdrnman]]' and 'Peter Parker'. What can we learn from this?
	- that he is a massive nerd, your honour
- but also that he faced the struggle of criminals: balancing the need to be anonymous enough not to be found by law enforcement, while well-known enough to be trusted and to get work
- it's a hard life ðŸŽ»

## Lesson 2: Personality
- behaviours are more likely to come from biosocial factors; that is, the interplay of social and biological factors
- Today we're talking about [[OCEAN]]
- the 'Dark Triad':
	- Psychoticism
	- [[OCEAN#Extraversion|Extraversion]], and specifically the sensation-seeking trait within extraversion
	- [[OCEAN#Neuroticism|Neuroticism]], in the aspect of instability
- These dimensions are often abbreviated to P.E.N, and Eysenck (1964) suggests they are a set of characteristics that render individuals more susceptible to acts of criminality
- However, another conception of the so-called 'Dark Triad' is:
	- Machiavellianism, associated with deception and a view of others that sees them as resources. It has a somewhat inverse relationship with [[OCEAN#Agreeableness]]. 
	- Narcissism: a sense of entitlement and inflated self, as well as a desire to have this reinforced by others
	- Finally, psychopathy, characterised by a lack of empathy and remorse as well as emotional superficiality
- these traits have been found to be positively correlated with:
	- aggression and violence (cf. Kerig & Stellwagen, 2010)
	- recidivism (Asscher et al., 2011)
	- substance abuse (Benning, Patrick, Hicks, Blonigen, & Krueger, 2003)
	- problematic or counterproductive work behaviours (O'Boyle, Forsyth, Banks, & McDaniel, 2012)
- Can we predict individuals demonstrating 'Dark Triad' behaviours from [[OCEAN]]?
	- in the case of psychopathy, yes
	- less so in the case of narcissism

## Lesson 3: Culture
- Hofstede and Meyer cultural dimensions
- Hofstede :cultural dimensions:
	- power distance: the degree to which a society accepts that power is not (should not be?) equally distributed
	- uncertainty avoidance: the level of aversion towards uncertainty and ambiguity
	- individualism vs collectivism
	- masculinity vs femininity
		- _yikes_
		- 'masculine' traits are, apparently:
			- a focus on accomplishments, achievements
			- valuing assertiveness
		- while 'feminine' traits are:
			- cooperation
			- modesty
			- protection of the weaker members of society
	- long-termism vs short-termism
	- indulgence vs restraint: gratification and pleasure-seeking versus suppression
- we can, and should, argue about the wording of some of this - but they are apparently quite generally applicable
- Meyer's cultural dimensions:
	- communicating (high/low context): does the communication contain the context (low context) or does the receiver need to know the context before hand (high context)? The latter allows for significantly more complex language 
	- evaluating: key measure here is whether honesty is valued over diplomacy when giving feedback, particularly negative feedback
	- leading (egalitarian/hierarchical)
	- deciding (top-down/consensus)
	- trusting: task-based, whereby trust is built on the basis of work completed, versus relationship-based, which is built on effective connections and personal interactions
	- tolerance for disagreeing
	- scheduling: linear time scheduling, where things happen one after the other according to a schedule, versus flexible time scheduling, where things happen when they happen
	- persuading: deductive, or principle-first versus inductive, or application-first
- within hacker subcultures, there are three common cultural norms:
	- technology
	- secrecy
	- mastery
- situational vs dispositional attribution: is a person's behaviour mostly driven by context and external factors, or internal attributes of that person?
	- guess which one makes it easier for the State to kill criminals

## Lesson 4: Profiling the cybercriminal
- Butkovic et al. (2019) claim that "there is an assumption underlying all approaches to criminal and cybercriminal profiling that the crime scene, and its extrapolation in cyberspace, provides details about the offence and the offender
- when profiling criminals, we can use inductive or deductive techniques
- inductive (or prospective):
	- by examining the behaviours of criminals we know about, we can identify similar criminals because they will share the same behaviours
	- naturally, the flaw with this approach is that it only tells us about criminals that we've managed to catch
	- this approach can be quantitative, using numerical data, or qualitative
- deductive (or retrospective):
	- start from the crime scene and the victim, working to identify the motivations and psychology of the offender
- behavioural evidence analysis:
	- equivocal forensic analysis: the evaluation of evidence
	- victimology: analysis of the characteristics of the victim, with a view to deducing the characteristics of the attacker
	- crime scene characteristics: in [[cyber crime|cybercrime]], this might be blended with step one. It may also include their [[TTP|tactics/techniques/ procedures]]
	- offender characteristics: examination of demographic and physical characteristics, modus operandi, etc
- thus, although it can be applied, BEA is more difficult to apply to cybercrime
- a different model has been proposed:
