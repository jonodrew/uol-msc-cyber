In this week we take a tour to explore criminal profiling. In order to do so, we examine identity, trust, personality, and culture, as key components. We examine a theoretical model for cybercriminal profiling and we discuss the complex relationships between personality traits, cultural influences, and individual identity in shaping criminal behaviour.

### Learning Objectives
---
- Explore the psychological theories and frameworks that explain criminal behavior, including psychopathy, antisocial personality disorder, and other relevant psychological constructs
- Analyse how personality traits, cultural influences, and individual identity interact and contribute to criminal tendencies
- Analyse case studies and research findings to understand the underlying psychological factors that drive criminal actions and decision-making processes
- Explore the human, psychological and behavioural aspects of [[attacker|attackers]] and targeted individuals

## Lesson 1: Identity and trust in [[cyber crime|cybercrime]]

- these days, individuals committing cybercrimes entirely by themselves are rare
- instead, there is a broader ecosystem within which criminals work, dividing their labour for more effective criming
- the nickname/handle is the entire brand
- however, using only one username is a single point of failure
- additionally, multiple identities allow for vertical integration and legal separation - you can get someone on the sale of malware but may not necessarily be able to link their natural identity to the 'making' identity
	- I call this the 'Sheinhardt Wig Company' approach ![[Pasted image 20230826121203.png]]
- Organised crime structures emerge as a response to a lack of trust and the overall uncertainty \[...] around the identity of the seller \[...] and around the quality of the products or services offered \[Yip et al., 2013]
	- is this true of other organisations, I wonder?
- Organisation breeds competition
- Competition results in a marketplace
- And the advertising approaches are pretty much the same as they are for legal products - free samples, money-back guarantees, extensive documentation...even offering free product to influencers!
	- *crimfluencers*
- there is also a class of criminal that preys on criminals, called rippers
	- nature red in tooth and claw, babeee
- actors have strategies in place to try to identify accounts that have been appropriated by law enforcement
- one approach is to ask the individual to commit an illegal act; however, many jurisdictions make provision for law enforcement agents to do exactly that
- collaboration is considered in the longer-term, and not merely in the short-term maximisation
	- cf. Game theory in repeated games
	- [Here's a cute Youtube explainer](https://youtu.be/emyi4z-O0ls?si=-eQzJoTg8hwg9y-L)
- referrals are also very important
	- criminals be reinventing society
- the seller of GOVRAT, who is also its maker, used aliases such as 'spdrnman' and 'Peter Parker'. What can we learn from this?
	- that he is a massive nerd, your honour
- but also that he faced the struggle of criminals: balancing the need to be anonymous enough not to be found by law enforcement, while well-known enough to be trusted and to get work
- it's a hard life ðŸŽ»
