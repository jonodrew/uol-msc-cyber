During this week we will discuss the evolution of cybercrime, including the emergence and advancements of ransomware, RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service), and CaaS (Crime-as-a-Service) models. We will explore the motivations behind cybercriminal activities and the rationality of their decision-making processes. In order to do so, we investigate criminological approaches and theories of crime and cybercrime.

### Learning Objectives

---

- Investigate the role of criminology in understanding cybercriminal behaviour and identify ways to enhance cybercrime prevention and detection
- Analyse the effectiveness of existing strategies in combating cybercrime and propose innovative solutions to mitigate its effects
- Explore the socio-economic implications of cybercrime on individuals, organisations, and society as a whole
- Evaluate the ethical dilemmas faced by both cybercriminals and law enforcement agencies in the realm of cybercrime
- Connect milestones in the evolution of cybercrime with practical challenges of minimising 

## Reading
- _[[Cybercrime â€“ The Psychology of Online Offenders]]_ : chapter 1, pp.16-26
## Lesson 1: Milestones and business models
- was telephone hacking in the 50s and 60 [[cyber crime|cybercrime]]?
- [[Tor]] and [[dark web|darknet]]
	- with the darknet, come darknet markets:
		- drugs
		- weapons
		- Murder-as-a-Service
		- [[CSA]] material
		- other illegal forms of pornography (cf. [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008#Section 63]])
		- stolen credentials
		- stolen credit cards
		- gaming related products and services
		- [[malware]] and other tools for use in [[cyber crime|cybercrime]]
- [[virtual private network|VPN]]: an encrypted, authenticated network
	- [[Safe-Inet]] - a VPN being used for [[cyber crime|cybercrime]], with five layers of connections
- [[end-to-end encryption]] apps, such as:
	- [[Telegram]]
	- [[Discord]]
- E2EE does not necessarily encrypt metadata, which can give law enforcement a way in
- [[organised crime]]
- note that as tools go from custom to product, the pool of potential users (and uses!) increases as barriers to entry are lowered. Furthermore, with resources no longer being spent down the value chain, existing cybercriminals can refocus their energies on more value-add nodes
- [[Ransomeware-as-a-Service]]
- [[Access-as-a-Service]]
- [[cryptocurrency]]
	- cryptocurrency enables [[money mules]] at scale, and with less risk
- in some cases, even legal businesses are brought into the fold
- [[Zeus]] is a fascinating insight into the evolving nature of criminality
>[!question] Consider the evolution of [[cyber crime|cybercrime]] and pick one angle. Does it assist criminals, or law enforcement?
>
>Programming has been democratised and re-specialised. Where there were once specialist safe-crackers, now there are malware developers.
>
>As specialisation increases, we see the market shrinking to a few good operators. However, those operators are turning out high-quality software.
>
>Naturally, this benefits criminals as they get higher quality software. However, it also helps law enforcement, as it introduces single points of failure that can be more effectively targeted

## Lesson 2: Criminology part 1
- criminology is a field of study, rather than a specific discipline
>[!quote] Criminology is the scientific study of crime as a social phenomenon, of criminal investigation, of criminals, and of penal treatment

- cyber criminology is a subset of criminology or possibly a totally new field of study
	- one definition is 'the study of causation of crimes that occur in the \[sic] cyberspace and its impact in the physical space'^[Jaishankar, 2007]
- 

## Lesson 3: Criminology part 2
### situational approaches
- crime as a routine activity (routine activity theory)
>[!quote] The probability that a violation will occur at any specific time and place might be taken as a function of the convergence of likely offenders and suitable targets in the absence of capable guardians
>
>\- Cohen and Felson, 1979

- given [[cyber crime|cybercrime]] actors are operating internationally, how do we apply models of societal conditions to the question of reducing such crimes?
- support for routine activity theory in the sphere of [[cyber crime|cybercrime]] however is mixed
	- nonetheless, let's take a look at it
	- guardianship can be broken down into:
		- personal: that is, the personal security hygiene of a potential victim, such as the use of an antivirus or firewall
		- physical: that is, the technical skillset of an the defender
- an important element of situational theory is rational choice theory
	- oh dear
	- as noted previously, 'rationality' is generally bounded - there's no such thing as a perfectly rational person
### Space transition theory
- a theory dedicated to [[cyber crime|cybercrime]] only, without seeking to explain traditional crime
- based on two hypotheses:
	- people behave differently online
	- individuals who have pressed their inclination for misbehaviour in the real world will express them in cyberspace
- cyberspace provides flexibility in self-presentation and its inverse - dissociative anonymity

### Victimology
