This week we look at aspects of cyber war and cyber terrorism. Computers have been used extensively by the military for many years to enhance the efficiency of military operations. In recent years defensive cyber has been joined by offensive cyber as computers are moving closer to the front line. Cyber terrorism is an extension of terrorist activities but using cyber, however, this has been more influenced by subversion and espionage than sabotage.

	- subversion

	- nation state attacks and actors
	- on computers or information networks
	- using [[virus|viruses]] or [[DDoS]] attacks
- consider [[Operation Orchard]] for example

- operations should: influence, defend, enable, or inform
- they are broken down into offensive and defensive operations
