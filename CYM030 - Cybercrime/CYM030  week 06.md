This week covers the legislation around cybercrime and touches on how cyber laws are created and the need for an international approach to cyber laws, as cybercrime itself is international. However, the main focus is on UK laws and the [[Computer Misuse Act 1990]] and the [[Fraud Act 2006 ]]in particular. These two acts form an important part of the fight against cybercrime. You should make yourself familiar with the major sections of these acts, but there is no need to memorise all the sections. Ransomware makes demands for money and Section 21 of the [[Theft Act 1968]] is used to deal with these blackmail treats. Other laws are also discussed and the issue of jurisdiction is covered in this week.

### Learning Objectives

---

- Explain how the international approach to cyber laws helps define UK legislation
- Analyse the [[Computer Misuse Act 1990]] and be able to apply it to various offences
- Describe aspects of applying civil and criminal law in cybercrime and the laws recommended in the international cybercrime convention
## Lesson 1: Creating international cyber laws
- the [[Internet]] has no borders
- there is international recognition that this means we need joined up, inter-national law
- the [[United Nations]] says that there is no international definition of [[cyber crime|cybercrime]]
- the [[Budapest Convention on cyber crime]] gets a mention
- the most recent [[Octopus Conference]] proposed profiling of cyber criminals
- another international body is [[Europol]]. We are most interested in the cybercrime unit: [[European Cybercrime Center|EC3]]
## Lesson 2: The [[Computer Misuse Act 1990]]

## Lesson 3: More on the [[Computer Misuse Act 1990]]
- some people argue that it's time to review the [[Computer Misuse Act 1990|CMA]]
	- see for example the [CyberUp Campaign](https://www.cyberupcampaign.com/)
	- and [this briefing for a debate on the act](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CDP-2022-0082/CDP-2022-0082.pdf)
	- Probably also worth reviewing the [National Cyber Strategy (2022)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-cyber-strategy-2022/national-cyber-security-strategy-2022)
## Lesson 4: [[Fraud Act 2006]]
- honourable mention for the word [inchoate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchoate_offences_in_English_law), which the autogenerated subtitles has understood as 'encoded'

## Lesson 5: Other laws
- [[Theft Act 1968]]
	- before this, theft was actually legal!
- [[Investigatory Powers Act 2016]]
	- I wonder how this ties to [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|RIPA]]
- [[Data Protection Act 2018]]

## Lesson 6: Case law
