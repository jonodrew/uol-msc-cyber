## Section 62
- worth noting that this section defines 'pornographic' as
>[!quote] ...if it is of such a nature that it must reasonably be assumed to have been produced solely or principally for the purpose of sexual arousal 
- makes it an offence to be in possession of a prohibited (??) image of a child
	- is this linked to the [[COPINE scale]]?
