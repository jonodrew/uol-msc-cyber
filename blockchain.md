Blockchain is - ðŸ¤¢

No, I can do this.

Blockchain is a decentralised immutable ledger. It is like a database, except slower, more expensive, and worse for the environment.

You can also build [[smart contracts]] on top of this system. Again, a basic bit of automation that could equally be done through technology we've had for literally decades.

New blocks are added to the chain through a consensus protocol.
