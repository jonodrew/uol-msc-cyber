- love an article from positive psychology dot com
- let's have a couple of theories
## [[Theory of Planned Behaviour]]/[[Theory of reasoned action]]
- Fishbein and Ajzen, 1970s (??)
- behaviours occur because of intention, and intention can be influenced by attitude and perceived social norm
- Ajzen extended this in the 80s (?? why are there no accurate dates on this? This isn't fucken archaeology) to incorporate perceived behavioural control as an influencer of _intention_, and sometimes directly on behaviour
- this extended model is the model of planned behaviour, as opposed to the above, which is known as '[[Theory of reasoned action]]'.
## Social cognitive theory
- [[Bandura]]! Now there's a name I haven't heard in a while
- we learn behaviours from others in our environment - specifically from role models. This is 'social observation'
- he considers three factors personal to an individual: their cognitive, affective, and biological factors

## How is behaviour change?
- ah, the interesting question. Let's have some more models
### Transtheoretical model
- sigh
- Prochaska and DiClemente, 1982, argue that there are six stages to making a change to one's behaviour:
	- precontemplation
	- contemplation
	- preparation
	- action
	- maintenance
	- termination
### information - motivation - behavioural skills model
- Fisher and Fisher
	- and Fisher?!![[Pasted image 20240710153750.png]]
	- listen these are my notes and I'll make stupid jokes if I want to
- three factors that influence behaviour change:
	- information *about*,
	- motivation *to*,
	- behavioural skills so that one *can*
### Behaviour change wheel and COM-B model
- This is from Michie, van Stralen, and West
- the hub requires three conditions:
	- capability
	- opportunity
	- motivation
- article claims that there is evidence that people already going through a change are susceptible to other, simultaneous changes
